    <h3 class="title editable block">Preface</h3>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-chpr_p01"><em class="emphasis">Business Communication for Success</em> (<em class="emphasis">BCS</em>) provides a comprehensive, integrated approach to the study and application of written and oral business communication to serve both student and professor.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-chpr_p02">This series features chapters with the following elements:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-chpr_l01">
        <li>Learning Objectives</li>
        <li>Introductory Exercises</li>
        <li>Clear expectations, relevant background, and important theories</li>
        <li>Practical, real-world examples</li>
        <li>Key Takeaways or quick internal summaries</li>
        <li>Key terms that are easily identified</li>
        <li>In-chapter assignments</li>
        <li>Postchapter assessments linked to objectives and skills acquisition</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-chpr_p03">Each chapter is self-contained, allowing for mix-and-match flexibility and custom or course-specific design. Each chapter focuses on clear objectives and skill demonstrations that can be easily linked to your syllabus and state or federal requirements. Supported by internal and external assessments, each chapter features time-saving and learning-enhancement support for instructors and students.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-chpr_p04"><em class="emphasis">BCS</em> is designed to help students identify important information, reinforce for retention, and demonstrate mastery with a clear outcome product.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-chpr_p05">The text has three content categories:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-chpr_l02">
        <li>Foundations</li>
        <li>Process and products</li>
        <li>Contexts</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-chpr_p06">The first three chapters form the core foundation for the study of oral and written business communication. The next sequence of chapters focus on the process of writing, then oral performance with an emphasis on results. The final sequence focuses on contexts where business communication occurs, from interpersonal to intercultural, from groups to leadership.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-chpr_p07">In each of the process and product chapter sequences, the chapters follow a natural flow, from prewriting to revision, from preparation for a presentation to performance. Each sequence comes together in a concluding chapter that focuses on action—where we apply the skills and techniques of written or oral communication in business, from writing a letter to presenting a sales speech. These performances not only serve to reinforce real-world applications but also may serve as course assessments. All chapters are compartmentalized into sections so you can choose what you want to use and eliminate the rest, and here the beauty of <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a> rings true—you can adapt and integrate content from other texts or your own work to truly make it fit your course and student needs.</p>
