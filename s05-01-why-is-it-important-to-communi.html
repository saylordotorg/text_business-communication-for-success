        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch01_s01_l01">
            <li>Recognize the importance of communication in gaining a better understanding of yourself and others.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_p01">Communication is key to your success—in relationships, in the workplace, as a citizen of your country, and across your lifetime. Your ability to communicate comes from experience, and experience can be an effective teacher, but this text and the related business communication course will offer you a wealth of experiences gathered from professional speakers across their lifetimes. You can learn from the lessons they’ve learned and be a more effective communicator right out of the gate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_p02">Business communication can be thought of as a problem solving activity in which individuals may address the following questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_l02">
        <li>What is the situation?</li>
        <li>What are some possible communication strategies?</li>
        <li>What is the best course of action?</li>
        <li>What is the best way to design the chosen message?</li>
        <li>What is the best way to deliver the message?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_p03">In this book, we will examine this problem solving process and help you learn to apply it in the kinds of situations you are likely to encounter over the course of your career.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Influences Your Thinking about Yourself and Others</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p01">We all share a fundamental drive to communicate. Communication can be defined as the process of understanding and sharing meaning.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_001">Pearson, J., &amp; Nelson, P. (2000). <em class="emphasis">An introduction to human communication: understanding and sharing</em> (p. 6). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span> You share meaning in what you say and how you say it, both in oral and written forms. If you could not communicate, what would life be like? A series of never-ending frustrations? Not being able to ask for what you need or even to understand the needs of others?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Being unable to communicate might even mean losing a part of yourself, for you communicate your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-concept</a><span class="glossdef">What we perceive ourselves to be.</span></span>—your sense of self and awareness of who you are—in many ways. Do you like to write? Do you find it easy to make a phone call to a stranger or to speak to a room full of people? Perhaps someone told you that you don’t speak clearly or your grammar needs improvement. Does that make you more or less likely to want to communicate? For some, it may be a positive challenge, while for others it may be discouraging. But in all cases, your ability to communicate is central to your self-concept.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p03">Take a look at your clothes. What are the brands you are wearing? What do you think they say about you? Do you feel that certain styles of shoes, jewelry, tattoos, music, or even automobiles express who you are? Part of your self-concept may be that you express yourself through texting, or through writing longer documents like essays and research papers, or through the way you speak.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p04">On the other side of the coin, your communications skills help you to understand others—not just their words, but also their tone of voice, their nonverbal gestures, or the format of their written documents provide you with clues about who they are and what their values and priorities may be. Active listening and reading are also part of being a successful communicator.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Influences How You Learn</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p01">When you were an infant, you learned to talk over a period of many months. When you got older, you didn’t learn to ride a bike, drive a car, or even text a message on your cell phone in one brief moment. You need to begin the process of improving your speaking and writing with the frame of mind that it will require effort, persistence, and self-correction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p02">You learn to speak in public by first having conversations, then by answering questions and expressing your opinions in class, and finally by preparing and delivering a “stand-up” speech. Similarly, you learn to write by first learning to read, then by writing and learning to think critically. Your speaking and writing are reflections of your thoughts, experience, and education. Part of that combination is your level of experience listening to other speakers, reading documents and styles of writing, and studying formats similar to what you aim to produce.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p03">As you study business communication, you may receive suggestions for improvement and clarification from speakers and writers more experienced than yourself. Take their suggestions as challenges to improve; don’t give up when your first speech or first draft does not communicate the message you intend. Stick with it until you get it right. Your success in communicating is a skill that applies to almost every field of work, and it makes a difference in your relationships with others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p04">Remember, luck is simply a combination of preparation and timing. You want to be prepared to communicate well when given the opportunity. Each time you do a good job, your success will bring more success.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Represents You and Your Employer</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s03_p01">You want to make a good first impression on your friends and family, instructors, and employer. They all want you to convey a positive image, as it reflects on them. In your career, you will represent your business or company in spoken and written form. Your professionalism and attention to detail will reflect positively on you and set you up for success.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s03_p02">In both oral and written situations, you will benefit from having the ability to communicate clearly. These are skills you will use for the rest of your life. Positive improvements in these skills will have a positive impact on your relationships, your prospects for employment, and your ability to make a difference in the world.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Skills Are Desired by Business and Industry</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s04_p01">Oral and written communication proficiencies are consistently ranked in the top ten desirable skills by employer surveys year after year. In fact, high-powered business executives sometimes hire consultants to coach them in sharpening their communication skills. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_002">National Association of Colleges and Employers. (2009). Frequently asked questions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s04_p03">In September 2004, the National Commission on Writing for America’s Families, Schools, and Colleges published a study on 120 human resource directors titled <em class="emphasis">Writing: A Ticket to Work…Or a Ticket Out, A Survey of Business Leaders</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_003">National Commission on Writing for America’s Families, Schools, and Colleges.

Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.writingcommission.org/pr/writing_for_employ.html">http://www.writingcommission.org/pr/writing_for_employ.html</a></span> The study found that “writing is both a ‘marker’ of high-skill, high-wage, professional work and a ‘gatekeeper’ with clear equity implications,” said Bob Kerrey, president of New School University in New York and chair of the commission. “People unable to express themselves clearly in writing limit their opportunities for professional, salaried employment.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_004">The College Board.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s04_p04">On the other end of the spectrum, it is estimated that over forty million Americans are illiterate, or unable to functionally read or write. If you are reading this book, you may not be part of an at-risk group in need of basic skill development, but you still may need additional training and practice as you raise your skill level.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s04_p05">An individual with excellent communication skills is an asset to every organization. No matter what career you plan to pursue, learning to express yourself professionally in speech and in writing will help you get there.</p>
