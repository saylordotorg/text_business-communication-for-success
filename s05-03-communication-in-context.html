<span class="title-prefix">1.3</span> Communication in Context</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>

            <li>Identify and describe five types of communication contexts.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_p01">Now that we have examined the eight components of communication, let’s examine this in context. Is a quiet dinner conversation with someone you care about the same experience as a discussion in class or giving a speech? Is sending a text message to a friend the same experience as writing a professional project proposal or a purchase order? Each context has an influence on the communication process. Contexts can overlap, creating an even more dynamic process. You have been communicating in many of these contexts across your lifetime, and you’ll be able to apply what you’ve learned through experience in each context to business communication.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Intrapersonal Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Have you ever listened to a speech or lecture and gotten caught up in your thoughts so that, while the speaker continued, you were no longer listening? During a phone conversation, have you ever been thinking about what you are going to say, or what question you might ask, instead of listening to the other person? Finally, have you ever told yourself how you did after you wrote a document or gave a presentation? As you “talk with yourself” you are engaged in intrapersonal communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Intrapersonal communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication with yourself.</span></span> involves one person; it is often called “self-talk.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_018">Wood, J. (1997). <em class="emphasis">Communication in our lives</em> (p. 22). Boston, MA: Wadsworth.</span> Donna Vocate’s<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_019">Vocate, D. (Ed.). (1994). <em class="emphasis">Intrapersonal communication: Different voices, different minds</em>. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</span> book on intrapersonal communication explains how, as we use language to reflect on our own experiences, we talk ourselves through situations. For example, the voice within you that tells you, “Keep on Going! I can DO IT!” when you are putting your all into completing a five-mile race; or that says, “This report I’ve written is pretty good.” Your intrapersonal communication can be positive or negative, and directly influences how you perceive and react to situations and communication with others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p03">What you perceive in communication with others is also influenced by your culture, native language, and your world view. As the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas said, “Every process of reaching understanding takes place against the background of a culturally ingrained preunderstanding.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_020">Habermas, J. (1984). <em class="emphasis">The theory of communicative action</em> (Vol. 1, p. 100). Boston, MA: Beacon Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p04">For example, you may have certain expectations of time and punctuality. You weren’t born with them, so where did you learn them? From those around you as you grew up. What was normal for them became normal for you, but not everyone’s idea of normal is the same.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p05">When your supervisor invites you to a meeting and says it will start at 7 p.m., does that mean 7:00 sharp, 7-ish, or even 7:30? In the business context, when a meeting is supposed to start at 9 a.m., is it promptly a 9 a.m.? Variations in time expectations depend on regional and national culture as well as individual corporate cultures. In some companies, everyone may be expected to arrive ten to fifteen minutes before the announced start time to take their seats and be ready to commence business at 9:00 sharp. In other companies, “meeting and greeting” from about 9 to 9:05 or even 9:10 is the norm. When you are unfamiliar with the expectations for a business event, it is always wise to err on the side of being punctual, regardless of what your internal assumptions about time and punctuality may be.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Interpersonal Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s02_p01">The second major context within the field of communication is interpersonal communication. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Interpersonal communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication between two people.</span></span> normally involves two people, and can range from intimate and very personal to formal and impersonal. You may carry on a conversation with a loved one, sharing a serious concern. Later, at work, you may have a brief conversation about plans for the weekend with the security guard on your way home. What’s the difference? Both scenarios involve interpersonal communication, but are different in levels of intimacy. The first example implies a trusting relationship established over time between two caring individuals. The second example level implies some previous familiarity, and is really more about acknowledging each other than any actual exchange of information, much like saying hello or goodbye.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Group Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s03_p01">Have you ever noticed how a small group of people in class sit near each other? Perhaps they are members of the same sports program, or just friends, but no doubt they often engage in group communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s03_p02">“<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Group communication</a><span class="glossdef">The exchange of information with those who are culturally, linguistically, and/or geographically alike.</span></span> is a dynamic process where a small number of people engage in a conversation.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_021">McLean, S. (2005). <em class="emphasis">The basics of interpersonal communication</em> (p. 14). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> Group communication is generally defined as involving three to eight people. The larger the group, the more likely it is to break down into smaller groups.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s03_p03">To take a page from marketing, does your audience have segments or any points of convergence/divergence? We could consider factors like age, education, sex, and location to learn more about groups and their general preferences as well as dislikes. You may find several groups within the larger audience, such as specific areas of education, and use this knowledge to increase your effectiveness as a business communicator.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Public Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s04_p01">In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication in which one person speaks or writes a message to a group of people.</span></span>, one person speaks to a group of people; the same is true of public written communication, where one person writes a message to be read by a small or large group. The speaker or writer may ask questions, and engage the audience in a discussion (in writing, examples are an e-mail discussion or a point-counter-point series of letters to the editor), but the dynamics of the conversation are distinct from group communication, where different rules apply. In a public speaking situation, the group normally defers to the speaker. For example, the boss speaks to everyone, and the sales team quietly listens without interruption.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s04_p02">This generalization is changing as norms and expectations change, and many cultures have a tradition of “call outs” or interjections that are not to be interpreted as interruptions or competition for the floor, but instead as affirmations. The boss may say, as part of a charged-up motivational speech, “Do you hear me?” and the sales team is expected to call back “Yes Sir!” The boss, as a public speaker, recognizes that intrapersonal communication (thoughts of the individual members) or interpersonal communication (communication between team members) may interfere with this classic public speaking dynamic of all to one, or the audience devoting all its attention to the speaker, and incorporate attention getting and engagement strategies to keep the sales team focused on the message.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Mass Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s05_p01">How do you tell everyone on campus where and when all the classes are held? Would a speech from the front steps work? Perhaps it might meet the need if your school is a very small one. A written schedule that lists all classes would be a better alternative. How do you let everyone know there is a sale on in your store, or that your new product will meet their needs, or that your position on a political issue is the same as your constituents? You send a message to as many people as you can through mass communication. Does everyone receive mass communication the same way the might receive a personal phone call? Not likely. Some people who receive mass mailings assume that they are “junk mail” (i.e., that they do not meet the recipients’ needs) and throw them away unopened. People may tune out a television advertisement with a click of the mute button, delete tweets or ignore friend requests on Facebook by the hundreds, or send all unsolicited e-mail straight to the spam folder unread.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s05_p02">Mass media is a powerful force in modern society and our daily lives, and is adapting rapidly to new technologies. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Mass communication</a><span class="glossdef">Involves sending a single message to a group.</span></span> involves sending a single message to a group. It allows us to communicate our message to a large number of people, but we are limited in our ability to tailor our message to specific audiences, groups, or individuals. As a business communicator, you can use multimedia as a visual aid or reference common programs, films, or other images that your audience finds familiar yet engaging. You can tweet a picture that is worth far more than 140 characters, and you are just as likely to elicit a significant response. By choosing messages or references that many audience members will recognize or can identify with, you can develop common ground and increase the appeal of your message.</p>
