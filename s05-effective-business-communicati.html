        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s00_p01">Communication is an activity, skill, and art that incorporates lessons learned across a wide spectrum of human knowledge. Perhaps the most time-honored form of communication is storytelling. We’ve told each other stories for ages to help make sense of our world, anticipate the future, and certainly to entertain ourselves. The art of storytelling draws on your understanding of yourself, your message, and how you communicate it to an audience that is simultaneously communicating back to you. Your anticipation, reaction, and adaptation to the process will determine how successfully you are able to communicate. You were not born knowing how to write or even how to talk—but in the process of growing up, you have undoubtedly learned how to tell, and how not tell, a story out loud and in writing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s00_p02">You didn’t learn to text in a day and didn’t learn all the codes—from LOL (laugh out loud) to BRB (be right back)—right away. In the same way, learning to communicate well requires you to read and study how others have expressed themselves, then adapt what you have learned to your present task—whether it is texting a brief message to a friend, presenting your qualifications in a job interview, or writing a business report. You come to this text with skills and an understanding that will provide a valuable foundation as we explore the communication process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s00_p03">Effective communication takes preparation, practice, and persistence. There are many ways to learn communication skills; the school of experience, or “hard knocks,” is one of them. But in the business environment, a “knock” (or lesson learned) may come at the expense of your credibility through a blown presentation to a client. The classroom environment, with a compilation of information and resources such as a text, can offer you a trial run where you get to try out new ideas and skills before you have to use them to communicate effectively to make a sale or form a new partnership. Listening to yourself, or perhaps the comments of others, may help you reflect on new ways to present, or perceive, thoughts, ideas and concepts. The net result is your growth; ultimately your ability to communicate in business will improve, opening more doors than you might anticipate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s00_p04">As you learn the material in this text, each part will contribute to the whole. The degree to which you attend to each part will ultimately help give you the skills, confidence, and preparation to use communication in furthering your career.</p>

Your ability to communicate comes from experience, and experience can be an effective teacher, but this text and the related business communication course will offer you a wealth of experiences gathered from professional speakers across their lifetimes. You can learn from the lessons they’ve learned and be a more effective communicator right out of the gate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_p02">Business communication can be thought of as a problem solving activity in which individuals may address the following questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_l02">
        <li>What is the situation?</li>
        <li>What are some possible communication strategies?</li>
        <li>What is the best course of action?</li>
        <li>What is the best way to design the chosen message?</li>
        <li>What is the best way to deliver the message?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_p03">In this book, we will examine this problem solving process and help you learn to apply it in the kinds of situations you are likely to encounter over the course of your career.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Influences Your Thinking about Yourself and Others</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p01">We all share a fundamental drive to communicate. Communication can be defined as the process of understanding and sharing meaning.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_001">Pearson, J., &amp; Nelson, P. (2000). <em class="emphasis">An introduction to human communication: understanding and sharing</em> (p. 6). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span> You share meaning in what you say and how you say it, both in oral and written forms. If you could not communicate, what would life be like? A series of never-ending frustrations? Not being able to ask for what you need or even to understand the needs of others?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Being unable to communicate might even mean losing a part of yourself, for you communicate your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-concept</a><span class="glossdef">What we perceive ourselves to be.</span></span>—your sense of self and awareness of who you are—in many ways. Do you like to write? Do you find it easy to make a phone call to a stranger or to speak to a room full of people? Perhaps someone told you that you don’t speak clearly or your grammar needs improvement. Does that make you more or less likely to want to communicate? For some, it may be a positive challenge, while for others it may be discouraging. But in all cases, your ability to communicate is central to your self-concept.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p03">Take a look at your clothes. What are the brands you are wearing? What do you think they say about you? Do you feel that certain styles of shoes, jewelry, tattoos, music, or even automobiles express who you are? Part of your self-concept may be that you express yourself through texting, or through writing longer documents like essays and research papers, or through the way you speak.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s01_p04">On the other side of the coin, your communications skills help you to understand others—not just their words, but also their tone of voice, their nonverbal gestures, or the format of their written documents provide you with clues about who they are and what their values and priorities may be. Active listening and reading are also part of being a successful communicator.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Influences How You Learn</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p01">When you were an infant, you learned to talk over a period of many months. When you got older, you didn’t learn to ride a bike, drive a car, or even text a message on your cell phone in one brief moment. You need to begin the process of improving your speaking and writing with the frame of mind that it will require effort, persistence, and self-correction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p02">You learn to speak in public by first having conversations, then by answering questions and expressing your opinions in class, and finally by preparing and delivering a “stand-up” speech. Similarly, you learn to write by first learning to read, then by writing and learning to think critically. Your speaking and writing are reflections of your thoughts, experience, and education. Part of that combination is your level of experience listening to other speakers, reading documents and styles of writing, and studying formats similar to what you aim to produce.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p03">As you study business communication, you may receive suggestions for improvement and clarification from speakers and writers more experienced than yourself. Take their suggestions as challenges to improve; don’t give up when your first speech or first draft does not communicate the message you intend. Stick with it until you get it right. Your success in communicating is a skill that applies to almost every field of work, and it makes a difference in your relationships with others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s01_s02_p04">Remember, luck is simply a combination of preparation and timing. You want to be prepared to communicate well when given the opportunity. Each time you do a good job, your success will bring more success.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_p01">Many theories have been proposed to describe, predict, and understand the behaviors and phenomena of which communication consists. When it comes to communicating in business, we are often less interested in theory than in making sure our communications generate the desired results. But in order to achieve results, it can be valuable to understand what communication is and how it works.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Defining Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s01_p01">The root of the word “communication” in Latin is <em class="emphasis">communicare</em>, which means to share, or to make common.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_005">Weekley, E. (1967). <em class="emphasis">An etymological dictionary of modern English</em> (Vol. 1, p. 338). New York, NY: Dover Publications.</span> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Communication</a><span class="glossdef">The process of understanding and sharing meaning.</span></span> is defined as the process of understanding and sharing meaning.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_006">Pearson, J., &amp; Nelson, P. (2000). <em class="emphasis">An introduction to human communication: Understanding and sharing</em> (p. 6). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s01_p02">At the center of our study of communication is the relationship that involves interaction between participants. This definition serves us well with its emphasis on the process, which we’ll examine in depth across this text, of coming to understand and share another’s point of view effectively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s01_p03">The first key word in this definition is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">process</a><span class="glossdef">A dynamic activity that is hard to describe because it changes.</span></span>. A process is a dynamic activity that is hard to describe because it changes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_007">Pearson, J., &amp; Nelson, P. (2000). <em class="emphasis">An introduction to human communication: Understanding and sharing</em>. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span> Imagine you are alone in your kitchen thinking. Someone you know (say, your mother) enters the kitchen and you talk briefly. What has changed? Now, imagine that your mother is joined by someone else, someone you haven’t met before—and this stranger listens intently as you speak, almost as if you were giving a speech. What has changed? Your perspective might change, and you might watch your words more closely. The feedback or response from your mother and the stranger (who are, in essence, your audience) may cause you to reevaluate what you are saying. When we interact, all these factors—and many more—influence the process of communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s01_p04">The second key word is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">understanding</a><span class="glossdef">To perceive, to interpret, and to relate our perception and interpretation to what we already know.</span></span>: “To understand is to perceive, to interpret, and to relate our perception and interpretation to what we already know.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_008">McLean, S.

Now your friend points out the window and you see a motorcycle lying on the ground. Understanding the words and the concepts or objects they refer to is an important part of the communication process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s01_p05">Next comes the word <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sharing</a><span class="glossdef">Doing something together with one or more other people.</span></span>. Sharing means doing something together with one or more people. You may share a joint activity, as when you share in compiling a report; or you may benefit jointly from a resource, as when you and several coworkers share a pizza. In communication, sharing occurs when you convey thoughts, feelings, ideas, or insights to others. You can also share with yourself (a process called intrapersonal communication) when you bring ideas to consciousness, ponder how you feel about something, or figure out the solution to a problem and have a classic “Aha!” moment when something becomes clear.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s01_p06">Finally, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">meaning</a><span class="glossdef">What we share through communication.</span></span> is what we share through communication. The word “bike” represents both a bicycle and a short name for a motorcycle. By looking at the context the word is used in and by asking questions, we can discover the shared meaning of the word and understand the message.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Eight Essential Components of Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_p01">In order to better understand the communication process, we can break it down into a series of eight essential components:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Source</li>

In a public speaking situation, the source is the person giving the speech. He or she conveys the message by sharing new information with the audience. The speaker also conveys a message through his or her tone of voice, body language, and choice of clothing. The speaker begins by first determining the message—what to say and how to say it. The second step involves encoding the message by choosing just the right order or the perfect words to convey the intended meaning. The third step is to present or send the information to the receiver or audience. Finally, by watching for the audience’s reaction, the source perceives how well they received the message and responds with clarification or supporting information.</p>

But that is just the beginning. The words are brought together with grammar and organization. You may choose to save your most important point for last. The message also consists of the way you say it—in a speech, with your tone of voice, your body language, and your appearance—and in a report, with your writing style, punctuation, and the headings and formatting you choose. In addition, part of the message may be the environment or context you present it in and the noise that might make your message hard to hear or see.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p02">Imagine, for example, that you are addressing a large audience of sales reps and are aware there is a World Series game tonight. Your audience might have a hard time settling down, but you may choose to open with, “I understand there is an important game tonight.” In this way, by expressing verbally something that most people in your audience are aware of and interested in, you might grasp and focus their attention.</p>

How many channels do you have on your television? Each channel takes up some space, even in a digital world, in the cable or in the signal that brings the message of each channel to your home. Television combines an audio signal you hear with a visual signal you see. Together they convey the message to the receiver or audience. Turn off the volume on your television. Can you still understand what is happening? Many times you can, because the body language conveys part of the message of the show. Now turn up the volume but turn around so that you cannot see the television. You can still hear the dialogue and follow the story line.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s03_p02">Similarly, when you speak or write, you are using a channel to convey your message. Spoken channels include face-to-face conversations, speeches, telephone conversations and voice mail messages, radio, public address systems, and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Written channels include letters, memorandums, purchase orders, invoices, newspaper and magazine articles, blogs, e-mail, text messages, tweets, and so forth.</p>

The quarterback throws the football (message) to a receiver, who must see and interpret where to catch the ball. The quarterback may intend for the receiver to “catch” his message in one way, but the receiver may see things differently and miss the football (the intended meaning) altogether.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s04_p02">As a receiver you listen, see, touch, smell, and/or taste to receive a message. Your audience “sizes you up,” much as you might check them out long before you take the stage or open your mouth. The nonverbal responses of your listeners can serve as clues on how to adjust your opening. By imagining yourself in their place, you anticipate what you would look for if you were them. Just as a quarterback plans where the receiver will be in order to place the ball correctly, you too can recognize the interaction between source and receiver in a business communication context. All of this happens at the same time, illustrating why and how communication is always changing.</p>

Verbal or nonverbal, all these feedback signals allow the source to see how well, how accurately (or how poorly and inaccurately) the message was received. Feedback also provides an opportunity for the receiver or audience to ask for clarification, to agree or disagree, or to indicate that the source could make the message more interesting. As the amount of feedback increases, the accuracy of communication also increases.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_012">Leavitt, H., &amp; Mueller, R. (1951).

As the source, you want to tell the reps to take advantage of the fact that it is World Series season to close sales on baseball-related sports gear. You state your message, but you hear no replies from your listeners. You might assume that this means they understood and agreed with you, but later in the month you might be disappointed to find that very few sales were made. If you followed up your message with a request for feedback (“Does this make sense? Do any of you have any questions?”) you might have an opportunity to clarify your message, and to find out whether any of the sales reps believed your suggestion would not work with their customers.</p>

The environment can also include factors like formal dress, that may indicate whether a discussion is open and caring or more professional and formal. People may be more likely to have an intimate conversation when they are physically close to each other, and less likely when they can only see each other from across the room. In that case, they may text each other, itself an intimate form of communication. The choice to text is influenced by the environment.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s07_p02">A presentation or discussion does not take place as an isolated event. When you came to class, you came from somewhere. So did the person seated next to you, as did the instructor. The degree to which the environment is formal or informal depends on the contextual expectations for communication held by the participants. The person sitting next to you may be used to informal communication with instructors, but this particular instructor may be used to verbal and nonverbal displays of respect in the academic environment. You may be used to formal interactions with instructors as well, and find your classmate’s question of “Hey Teacher, do we have homework today?” as rude and inconsiderate when they see it as normal. The nonverbal response from the instructor will certainly give you a clue about how they perceive the interaction, both the word choices and how they were said.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s07_p03">Context is all about what people expect from each other, and we often create those expectations out of environmental cues. Traditional gatherings like weddings or quinceañeras are often formal events. There is a time for quiet social greetings, a time for silence as the bride walks down the aisle, or the father may have the first dance with his daughter as she is transformed from a girl to womanhood in the eyes of her community. In either celebration there may come a time for rambunctious celebration and dancing. You may be called upon to give a toast, and the wedding or quinceañera context will influence your presentation, timing, and effectiveness.</p>

Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> For example, if you drove a car to work or school, chances are you were surrounded by noise. Car horns, billboards, or perhaps the radio in your car interrupted your thoughts, or your conversation with a passenger.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s08_p02">Psychological noise is what happens when your thoughts occupy your attention while you are hearing, or reading, a message. Imagine that it is 4:45 p.m. and your boss, who is at a meeting in another city, e-mails you asking for last month’s sales figures, an analysis of current sales projections, and the sales figures from the same month for the past five years. You may open the e-mail, start to read, and think, “Great—no problem—I have those figures and that analysis right here in my computer.” You fire off a reply with last month’s sales figures and the current projections attached. Then, at five o’clock, you turn off your computer and go home. The next morning, your boss calls on the phone to tell you he was inconvenienced because you neglected to include the sales figures from the previous years. What was the problem? Interference: by thinking about how you wanted to respond to your boss’s message, you prevented yourself from reading attentively enough to understand the whole message.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s08_p03">Interference can come from other sources, too. Perhaps you are hungry, and your attention to your current situation interferes with your ability to listen. Maybe the office is hot and stuffy. If you were a member of an audience listening to an executive speech, how could this impact your ability to listen and participate?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s02_s08_p04">Noise interferes with normal encoding and decoding of the message carried by the channel between source and receiver.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Two Models of Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s03_p01">Researchers have observed that when communication takes place, the source and the receiver may send messages at the same time, often overlapping. You, as the speaker, will often play both roles, as source and receiver. You’ll focus on the communication and the reception of your messages to the audience. The audience will respond in the form of feedback that will give you important clues. While there are many models of communication, here we will focus on two that offer perspectives and lessons for business communicators.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s02_s03_p02">Rather than looking at the source sending a message and someone receiving it as two distinct acts, researchers often view communication as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transactional</a><span class="glossdef">Model of communication in which actions happen at the same time.</span></span> process (<a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch01_s02_s03_f01">Figure 1.3 "Transactional Model of Communication"</a>), with actions often happening at the same time. The distinction between source and receiver is blurred in conversational turn-taking, for example, where both participants play both roles simultaneously.</p>

When asked if you want a “Coke,” you may reply, “sure.” The waiter may then ask you again, “what kind?” and you may reply, “Coke is fine.” The waiter then may ask a third time, “what kind of soft drink would you like?” The misunderstanding in this example is that in Atlanta, the home of the Coca-Cola Company, most soft drinks are generically referred to as “Coke.” When you order a soft drink, you need to specify what type, even if you wish to order a beverage that is not a cola or not even made by the Coca-Cola Company. To someone from other regions of the United States, the words “pop,” “soda pop,” or “soda” may be the familiar way to refer to a soft drink; not necessarily the brand “Coke.” In this example, both you and the waiter understand the word “Coke,” but you each understand it to mean something different. In order to communicate, you must each realize what the term means to the other person, and establish common ground, in order to fully understand the request and provide an answer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Have you ever listened to a speech or lecture and gotten caught up in your thoughts so that, while the speaker continued, you were no longer listening? During a phone conversation, have you ever been thinking about what you are going to say, or what question you might ask, instead of listening to the other person? Finally, have you ever told yourself how you did after you wrote a document or gave a presentation? As you “talk with yourself” you are engaged in intrapersonal communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Intrapersonal communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication with yourself.</span></span> involves one person; it is often called “self-talk.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_018">Wood, J.

(1994). <em class="emphasis">Intrapersonal communication: Different voices, different minds</em>. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</span> book on intrapersonal communication explains how, as we use language to reflect on our own experiences, we talk ourselves through situations. For example, the voice within you that tells you, “Keep on Going! I can DO IT!” when you are putting your all into completing a five-mile race; or that says, “This report I’ve written is pretty good.” Your intrapersonal communication can be positive or negative, and directly influences how you perceive and react to situations and communication with others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p03">What you perceive in communication with others is also influenced by your culture, native language, and your world view. As the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas said, “Every process of reaching understanding takes place against the background of a culturally ingrained preunderstanding.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn01_020">Habermas, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p04">For example, you may have certain expectations of time and punctuality. You weren’t born with them, so where did you learn them? From those around you as you grew up. What was normal for them became normal for you, but not everyone’s idea of normal is the same.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s01_p05">When your supervisor invites you to a meeting and says it will start at 7 p.m., does that mean 7:00 sharp, 7-ish, or even 7:30? In the business context, when a meeting is supposed to start at 9 a.m., is it promptly a 9 a.m.? Variations in time expectations depend on regional and national culture as well as individual corporate cultures. In some companies, everyone may be expected to arrive ten to fifteen minutes before the announced start time to take their seats and be ready to commence business at 9:00 sharp. In other companies, “meeting and greeting” from about 9 to 9:05 or even 9:10 is the norm. When you are unfamiliar with the expectations for a business event, it is always wise to err on the side of being punctual, regardless of what your internal assumptions about time and punctuality may be.</p>

What’s the difference? Both scenarios involve interpersonal communication, but are different in levels of intimacy. The first example implies a trusting relationship established over time between two caring individuals. The second example level implies some previous familiarity, and is really more about acknowledging each other than any actual exchange of information, much like saying hello or goodbye.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s04_p01">In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication in which one person speaks or writes a message to a group of people.</span></span>, one person speaks to a group of people; the same is true of public written communication, where one person writes a message to be read by a small or large group. The speaker or writer may ask questions, and engage the audience in a discussion (in writing, examples are an e-mail discussion or a point-counter-point series of letters to the editor), but the dynamics of the conversation are distinct from group communication, where different rules apply. In a public speaking situation, the group normally defers to the speaker. For example, the boss speaks to everyone, and the sales team quietly listens without interruption.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s04_p02">This generalization is changing as norms and expectations change, and many cultures have a tradition of “call outs” or interjections that are not to be interpreted as interruptions or competition for the floor, but instead as affirmations. The boss may say, as part of a charged-up motivational speech, “Do you hear me?” and the sales team is expected to call back “Yes Sir!” The boss, as a public speaker, recognizes that intrapersonal communication (thoughts of the individual members) or interpersonal communication (communication between team members) may interfere with this classic public speaking dynamic of all to one, or the audience devoting all its attention to the speaker, and incorporate attention getting and engagement strategies to keep the sales team focused on the message.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Mass Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s05_p01">How do you tell everyone on campus where and when all the classes are held? Would a speech from the front steps work? Perhaps it might meet the need if your school is a very small one. A written schedule that lists all classes would be a better alternative. How do you let everyone know there is a sale on in your store, or that your new product will meet their needs, or that your position on a political issue is the same as your constituents? You send a message to as many people as you can through mass communication. Does everyone receive mass communication the same way the might receive a personal phone call? Not likely. Some people who receive mass mailings assume that they are “junk mail” (i.e., that they do not meet the recipients’ needs) and throw them away unopened. People may tune out a television advertisement with a click of the mute button, delete tweets or ignore friend requests on Facebook by the hundreds, or send all unsolicited e-mail straight to the spam folder unread.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s03_s05_p02">Mass media is a powerful force in modern society and our daily lives, and is adapting rapidly to new technologies. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Mass communication</a><span class="glossdef">Involves sending a single message to a group.</span></span> involves sending a single message to a group. It allows us to communicate our message to a large number of people, but we are limited in our ability to tailor our message to specific audiences, groups, or individuals. As a business communicator, you can use multimedia as a visual aid or reference common programs, films, or other images that your audience finds familiar yet engaging. You can tweet a picture that is worth far more than 140 characters, and you are just as likely to elicit a significant response. By choosing messages or references that many audience members will recognize or can identify with, you can develop common ground and increase the appeal of your message.</p>

    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch01_s04_l01">
            <li>Discuss and provide several examples of each of the two main responsibilities of a business communicator.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_p01">Whenever you speak or write in a business environment, you have certain responsibilities to your audience, your employer, and your profession. Your audience comes to you with an inherent set of expectations that you will fulfill these responsibilities. The specific expectations may change given the context or environment, but two central ideas will remain: be prepared, and be ethical.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Communicator Is Prepared</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_p01">As the business communicator’s first responsibility, preparation includes several facets which we will examine: organization, clarity, and being concise and punctual.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_p02">Being prepared means that you have selected a topic appropriate to your audience, gathered enough information to cover the topic well, put your information into a logical sequence, and considered how best to present it. If your communication is a written one, you have written an outline and at least one rough draft, read it over to improve your writing and correct errors, and sought feedback where appropriate. If your communication is oral, you have practiced several times before your actual performance.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Prepared Communicator Is Organized</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p01">Part of being prepared is being organized. Aristotle called this <em class="emphasis">logos</em>, or logic, and it involves the steps or points that lead your communication to a conclusion. Once you’ve invested time in researching your topic, you will want to narrow your focus to a few key points and consider how you’ll present them. On any given topic there is a wealth of information; your job is to narrow that content down to a manageable level, serving the role of gatekeeper by selecting some information and “de-selecting,” or choosing to not include other points or ideas.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p02">You also need to consider how to link your main points together for your audience. Use transitions to provide signposts or cues for your audience to follow along. “Now that we’ve examined X, let’s consider Y” is a transitional statement that provides a cue that you are moving from topic to topic. Your listeners or readers will appreciate your being well organized so that they can follow your message from point to point.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Prepared Communicator Is Clear</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p01">You have probably had the unhappy experience of reading or listening to a communication that was vague and wandering. Part of being prepared is being clear. If your message is unclear, the audience will lose interest and tune you out, bringing an end to effective communication.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p02">Interestingly, clarity begins with intrapersonal communication: you need to have a clear idea in your mind of what you want to say before you can say it clearly to someone else. At the interpersonal level, clarity involves considering your audience, as you will want to choose words and phrases they understand and avoid jargon or slang that may be unfamiliar to them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p03">Clarity also involves presentation. A brilliant message scrawled in illegible handwriting, or in pale gray type on gray paper, will not be clear. When it comes to oral communication, if you mumble your words, speak too quickly or use a monotonous tone of voice, or stumble over certain words or phrases, the clarity of your presentation will suffer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p04">Technology also plays a part; if you are using a microphone or conducting a teleconference, clarity will depend on this equipment functioning properly—which brings us back to the importance of preparation. In this case, in addition to preparing your speech, you need to prepare by testing the equipment ahead of time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Prepared Communicator Is Concise and Punctual</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p01">Concise means brief and to the point. In most business communications you are expected to “get down to business” right away. Being prepared includes being able to state your points clearly and support them with clear evidence in a relatively straightforward, linear way.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p02">It may be tempting to show how much you know by incorporating additional information into your document or speech, but in so doing you run the risk of boring, confusing, or overloading your audience. Talking in circles or indulging in tangents, where you get off topic or go too deep, can hinder an audience’s ability to grasp your message. Be to the point and concise in your choice of words, organization, and even visual aids.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p03">Being concise also involves being sensitive to time constraints. How many times have you listened to a speaker say “in conclusion” only to continue speaking for what seems like forever? How many meetings and conference calls have you attended that got started late or ran beyond the planned ending time? The solution, of course, is to be prepared to be punctual. If you are asked to give a five-minute presentation at a meeting, your coworkers will not appreciate your taking fifteen minutes, any more than your supervisor would appreciate your submitting a fifteen-page report when you were asked to write five pages. For oral presentations, time yourself when you rehearse and make sure you can deliver your message within the allotted number of minutes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s01_s03_p04">There is one possible exception to this principle. Many non-Western cultures prefer a less direct approach, where business communication often begins with social or general comments that a U.S. audience might consider unnecessary. Some cultures also have a less strict interpretation of time schedules and punctuality. While it is important to recognize that different cultures have different expectations, the general rule holds true that good business communication does not waste words or time.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Communicator Is Ethical</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_p01">The business communicator’s second fundamental responsibility is to be ethical. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ethics</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to a set of principles or rules for correct conduct.</span></span> refers to a set of principles or rules for correct conduct. It echoes what Aristotle called <em class="emphasis">ethos</em>, the communicator’s good character and reputation for doing what is right. Communicating ethically involves being egalitarian, respectful, and trustworthy—overall, practicing the “golden rule” of treating your audience the way you would want to be treated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_p02">Communication can move communities, influence cultures, and change history. It can motivate people to take stand, consider an argument, or purchase a product. The degree to which you consider both the common good and fundamental principles you hold to be true when crafting your message directly relates to how your message will affect others.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Ethical Communicator Is Egalitarian</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s01_p01">The word “egalitarian” comes from the root “equal.” To be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">egalitarian</a><span class="glossdef">Believing in basic equality.</span></span> is to believe in basic equality: that all people should share equally in the benefits and burdens of a society. It means that everyone is entitled to the same respect, expectations, access to information, and rewards of participation in a group.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s01_p02">To communicate in an egalitarian manner, speak and write in a way that is comprehensible and relevant to all your listeners or readers, not just those who are “like you” in terms of age, gender, race or ethnicity, or other characteristics.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s01_p03">In business, you will often communicate to people with certain professional qualifications. For example, you may draft a memo addressed to all the nurses in a certain hospital, or give a speech to all the adjusters in a certain branch of an insurance company. Being egalitarian does not mean you have to avoid professional terminology that is understood by nurses or insurance adjusters. But it does mean that your hospital letter should be worded for all the hospital’s nurses—not just female nurses, not just nurses working directly with patients, not just nurses under age fifty-five. An egalitarian communicator seeks to unify the audience by using ideas and language that are appropriate for all the message’s readers or listeners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Ethical Communicator Is Respectful</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p01">People are influenced by emotions as well as logic. Aristotle named <em class="emphasis">pathos</em>, or passion, enthusiasm and energy, as the third of his three important parts of communicating after <em class="emphasis">logos</em> and <em class="emphasis">ethos</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p02">Most of us have probably seen an audience manipulated by a “cult of personality,” believing whatever the speaker said simply because of how dramatically he or she delivered a speech; by being manipulative, the speaker fails to respect the audience. We may have also seen people hurt by sarcasm, insults, and other disrespectful forms of communication.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p03">This does not mean that passion and enthusiasm are out of place in business communication. Indeed, they are very important. You can hardly expect your audience to care about your message if you don’t show that you care about it yourself. If your topic is worth writing or speaking about, make an effort to show your audience why it is worthwhile by speaking enthusiastically or using a dynamic writing style. Doing so, in fact, shows respect for their time and their intelligence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s02_p04">However, the ethical communicator will be passionate and enthusiastic without being disrespectful. Losing one’s temper and being abusive are generally regarded as showing a lack of professionalism (and could even involve legal consequences for you or your employer). When you disagree strongly with a coworker, feel deeply annoyed with a difficult customer, or find serious fault with a competitor’s product, it is important to express such sentiments respectfully. For example, instead of telling a customer, “I’ve had it with your complaints!” a respectful business communicator might say, “I’m having trouble seeing how I can fix this situation. Would you explain to me what you want to see happen?”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Ethical Communicator Is Trustworthy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p01">Trust is a key component in communication, and this is especially true in business. As a consumer, would you choose to buy merchandise from a company you did not trust? If you were an employer, would you hire someone you did not trust?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p02">Your goal as a communicator is to build a healthy relationship with your audience, and to do that you must show them why they can trust you and why the information you are about to give them is believable. One way to do this is to begin your message by providing some information about your qualifications and background, your interest in the topic, or your reasons for communicating at this particular time.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p03">Your audience will expect that what you say is the truth as you understand it. This means that you have not intentionally omitted, deleted, or taken information out of context simply to prove your points. They will listen to what you say and how you say it, but also to what you don’t say or do. You may consider more than one perspective on your topic, and then select the perspective you perceive to be correct, giving concrete reasons why you came to this conclusion. People in the audience may have considered or believe in some of the perspectives you consider, and your attention to them will indicate you have done your homework.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s03_p04">Being worthy of trust is something you earn with an audience. Many wise people have observed that trust is hard to build but easy to lose. A communicator may not know something and still be trustworthy, but it’s a violation of trust to pretend you know something when you don’t. Communicate what you know, and if you don’t know something, research it before you speak or write. If you are asked a question to which you don’t know the answer, say “I don’t know the answer but I will research it and get back to you” (and then make sure you follow through later). This will go over much better with the audience than trying to cover by stumbling through an answer or portraying yourself as knowledgeable on an issue that you are not.</p>

        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s04">

            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch01_s04_s02_s04_p01">When in doubt, remember the “golden rule,” which says to treat others the way you would like to be treated. In all its many forms, the golden rule incorporates human kindness, cooperation, and reciprocity across cultures, languages, backgrounds and interests. Regardless of where you travel, who you communicate with, or what your audience is like, remember how you would feel if you were on the receiving end of your communication, and act accordingly.</p>
