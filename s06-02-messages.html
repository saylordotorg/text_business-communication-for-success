    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_p01">Before we explore the principles of language, it will be helpful to stop for a moment and examine some characteristics of the messages we send when we communicate. When you write or say something, you not only share the meaning(s) associated with the words you choose, but you also say something about yourself and your relationship to the intended recipient. In addition, you say something about what the relationship means to you as well as your assumed familiarity as you choose formal or informal ways of expressing yourself. Your message may also carry unintended meanings that you cannot completely anticipate. Some words are loaded with meaning for some people, so that by using such words you can “push their buttons” without even realizing what you’ve done. Messages carry far more than the literal meaning of each word, and in this section we explore that complexity.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Primary Message Is Not the Whole Message</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01_p01">When considering how to effectively use verbal communication, keep in mind there are three distinct types of messages you will be communicating: primary, secondary, and auxiliary.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn02_006">Hasling, J. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Audience, message, speaker</em>. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Primary messages</a><span class="glossdef">Refer to the intentional content in a message, both verbal and nonverbal.</span></span> refer to the intentional content, both verbal and nonverbal. These are the words or ways you choose to express yourself and communicate your message. For example, if you are sitting at your desk and a coworker stops by to ask you a question, you may say, “Here, have a seat.” These words are your primary message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01_p03">Even such a short, seemingly simple and direct message could be misunderstood. It may seem obvious that you are not literally offering to “give” a “seat” to your visitor, but to someone who knows only formal English and is unfamiliar with colloquial expressions, it may be puzzling. “Have a seat” may be much more difficult to understand than “please sit down.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Secondary messages</a><span class="glossdef">Refer to the unintentional content in a message, both verbal and nonverbal.</span></span> refer to the unintentional content, both verbal and nonverbal. Your audience will form impressions of your intentional messages, both negative and positive, over which you have no control. Perceptions of physical attractiveness, age, gender, or ethnicity or even simple mannerisms and patterns of speech may unintentionally influence the message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01_p05">Perhaps, out of courtesy, you stand up while offering your visitor a seat; or perhaps your visitor has an expectation that you ought to do so. Perhaps a photograph of your family on your desk makes an impression on your visitor. Perhaps a cartoon on your bulletin board sends a message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Auxiliary messages</a><span class="glossdef">Refer to the intentional and unintentional ways a primary message is communicated.</span></span> refer to the intentional and unintentional ways a primary message is communicated. This may include vocal inflection, gestures and posture, or rate of speech that influence the interpretation or perception of your message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s01_p07">When you say, “Here, have a seat,” do you smile and wave your hand to indicate the empty chair on the other side of your desk? Or do you look flustered and quickly lift a pile of file folders out of the way? Are your eyes on your computer as you finish sending an e-mail before turning your attention to your visitor? Your auxiliary message might be, “I’m glad you came by, I always enjoy exchanging ideas with you” or “I always learn something new when someone asks me a question.” On the other hand, it might be, “I’ll answer your question, but I’m too busy for a long discussion,” or maybe even, “I wish you’d do your work and not bother me with your dumb questions!”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Parts of a Message</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p01">When you create a message, it is often helpful to think of it as having five parts:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Attention statement</li>
            <li>Introduction</li>
            <li>Body</li>
            <li>Conclusion</li>
            <li>Residual message</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p02">Each of these parts has its own function.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attention statement</a><span class="glossdef">The way you focus the audience’s attention on you and your speech.</span></span>, as you may guess, is used to capture the attention of your audience. While it may be used anywhere in your message, it is especially useful at the outset. There are many ways to attract attention from readers or listeners, but one of the most effective is the “what’s in it for me” strategy: telling them how your message can benefit them. An attention statement like, “I’m going to explain how you can save up to $500 a year on car insurance” is quite likely to hold an audience’s attention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p04">Once you have your audience’s attention, it is time to move on to the introduction. In your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">introduction</a><span class="glossdef">Part of a speech that establishes a relationship with your audience and clearly states your topic.</span></span> you will make a clear statement your topic; this is also the time to establish a relationship with your audience. One way to do this is to create common ground with the audience, drawing on familiar or shared experiences, or by referring to the person who introduced you. You may also explain why you chose to convey this message at this time, why the topic is important to you, what kind of expertise you have, or how your personal experience has led you to share this message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p05">After the introduction comes the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">body</a><span class="glossdef">Main content area of a speech.</span></span> of your message. Here you will present your message in detail, using any of a variety of organizational structures. Regardless of the type of organization you choose for your document or speech, it is important to make your main points clear, provide support for each point, and use transitions to guide your readers or listeners from one point to the next.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p06">At the end of the message, your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conclusion</a><span class="glossdef">Part of a speech that provides the audience with a sense of closure by summarizing the main points and relating the points to the overall topic.</span></span> should provide the audience with a sense of closure by summarizing your main points and relating them to the overall topic. In one sense, it is important to focus on your organizational structure again and incorporate the main elements into your summary, reminding the audience of what you have covered. In another sense, it is important not to merely state your list of main points again, but to convey a sense that you have accomplished what you stated you would do in your introduction, allowing the audience to have psychological closure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p07">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">residual message</a><span class="glossdef">Idea or thought that stays with your audience well after the speech.</span></span>, a message or thought that stays with your audience well after the communication is finished, is an important part of your message. Ask yourself of the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_l02">
            <li>What do I want my listeners or readers to remember?</li>
            <li>What information do I want to have the audience retain or act upon?</li>
            <li>What do I want the audience to do?</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch02_s02_s02_p08">Messages are primary, secondary, and auxiliary. A message can be divided into a five-part structure composed of an attention statement, introduction, body, conclusion, and residual message.</p>

                <li>Choose three examples of communication and identify the primary message. Share and compare with classmates.</li>
                <li>Choose three examples of communication and identify the auxiliary message(s). Share and compare with classmates.</li>
                <li>Think of a time when someone said something like “please take a seat” and you correctly or incorrectly interpreted the message as indicating that you were in trouble and about to be reprimanded. Share and compare with classmates.</li>
                <li>How does language affect self-concept? Explore and research your answer, finding examples that can serve as case studies.</li>
                <li>Choose an article or opinion piece from a major newspaper or news Web site. Analyze the piece according to the five-part structure described here. Does the headline serve as a good attention statement? Does the piece conclude with a sense of closure? How are the main points presented and supported? Share your analysis with your classmates. For a further challenge, watch a television commercial and do the same analysis.</li>
