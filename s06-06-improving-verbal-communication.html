    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_p01">Throughout the chapter we have visited examples and stories that highlight the importance of verbal communication. To end the chapter, we need to consider how language can be used to enlighten or deceive, encourage or discourage, empower or destroy. By defining the terms we use and choosing precise words, we will maximize our audience’s understanding of our message. In addition, it is important to consider the audience, control your tone, check for understanding, and focus on results. Recognizing the power of verbal communication is the first step to understanding its role and impact on the communication process.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Define Your Terms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s01_p01">Even when you are careful to craft your message clearly and concisely, not everyone will understand every word you say or write. As an effective business communicator, you know it is your responsibility to give your audience every advantage in understanding your meaning. Yet your presentation would fall flat if you tried to define each and every term—you would end up sounding like a dictionary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s01_p02">The solution is to be aware of any words you are using that may be unfamiliar to your audience. When you identify an unfamiliar word, your first decision is whether to use it or to substitute a more common, easily understood word. If you choose to use the unfamiliar word, then you need to decide how to convey its meaning to those in your audience who are not familiar with it. You may do this in a variety of ways. The most obvious, of course, is to state the meaning directly or to rephrase the term in different words. But you may also convey the meaning in the process of making and supporting your points. Another way is to give examples to illustrate each concept, or use parallels from everyday life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s01_p03">Overall, keep your audience in mind and imagine yourself in their place. This will help you to adjust your writing level and style to their needs, maximizing the likelihood that your message will be understood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Choose Precise Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s02_p01">To increase understanding, choose <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">precise words</a><span class="glossdef">Words that paint as vivid and accurate a mental picture as possible for your audience.</span></span> that paint as vivid and accurate a mental picture as possible for your audience. If you use language that is vague or abstract, your meaning may be lost or misinterpreted. Your document or presentation will also be less dynamic and interesting than it could be.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Consider Your Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s03_p01">In addition to precise words and clear definitions, contextual clues are important to guide your audience as they read. If you are speaking to a general audience and choose to use a word in professional jargon that may be understood by many—but not all—of the people in your audience, follow it by a common reference that clearly relates its essential meaning. With this positive strategy you will be able to forge relationships with audience members from diverse backgrounds. Internal summaries tell us what we’ve heard and forecast what is to come. It’s not just the words, but also how people hear them that counts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s03_p02">If you say the magic words “in conclusion,” you set in motion a set of expectations that you are about to wrap it up. If, however, you introduce a new point and continue to speak, the audience will perceive an expectancy violation and hold you accountable. You said the magic words but didn’t honor them. One of the best ways to display respect for your audience is to not exceed the expected time in a presentation or length in a document. Your careful attention to contextual clues will demonstrate that you are clearly considering your audience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Take Control of Your Tone</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s04_p01">Does your writing or speech sound pleasant and agreeable? Simple or sophisticated? Or does it come across as stuffy, formal, bloated, ironic, sarcastic, flowery, rude, or inconsiderate? Recognizing our own tone is not always easy, as we tend to read or listen from our own viewpoint and make allowances accordingly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s04_p02">Once we have characterized our tone, we need to decide whether and how it can be improved. Getting a handle on how to influence tone and to make your voice match your intentions takes time and skill.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s04_p03">One useful tip is to read your document out loud before you deliver it, just as you would practice a speech before you present it to an audience. Sometimes hearing your own words can reveal their tone, helping you decide whether it is correct or appropriate for the situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s04_p04">Another way is to listen or watch others’ presentations that have been described with terms associated with tone. Martin Luther King Jr. had one style while President Barack Obama has another. The writing in <em class="emphasis">The Atlantic</em> is far more sophisticated than the simpler writing in <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, yet both are very successful with their respective audiences. What kind of tone is best for your intended audience?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s04_p05">Finally, seek out and be receptive to feedback from teachers, classmates, and coworkers. Don’t just take the word of one critic, but if several critics point to a speech as an example of pompous eloquence, and you don’t want to come across in your presentation as pompous, you may learn from that example speech what to avoid.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Check for Understanding</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s05_p01">When we talk to each other face-to-face, seeing if someone understood you isn’t all that difficult. Even if they really didn’t get it, you can see, ask questions, and clarify right away. That gives oral communication, particularly live interaction, a distinct advantage. Use this immediacy for feedback to your advantage. Make time for feedback and plan for it. Ask clarifying questions. Share your presentation with more than one person, and choose people that have similar characteristics to your anticipated audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s05_p02">If you were going to present to a group that you knew in advance was of a certain age, sex, or professional background, it would only make sense to connect with someone from that group prior to your actual performance to check and see if what you have created and what they expect are similar. In oral communication, feedback is core component of the communication model and we can often see it, hear it, and it takes less effort to assess it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Be Results Oriented</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s06_p01">At the end of the day, the assignment has to be complete. It can be a challenge to balance the need for attention to detail with the need to arrive at the end product—and its due date. Stephen Covey<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn02_019">Covey, S. (1989). <em class="emphasis">The seven habits of highly effective people</em>. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster.</span> suggests beginning with the end in mind as one strategy for success. If you have done your preparation, know your assignment goals, desired results, have learned about your audience and tailored the message to their expectations, then you are well on your way to completing the task. No document or presentation is perfect, but the goal itself is worthy of your continued effort for improvement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s06_p02">Here the key is to know when further revision will not benefit the presentation and to shift the focus to test marketing, asking for feedback, or simply sharing it with a mentor or coworker for a quick review. Finding balance while engaging in an activity that requires a high level of attention to detail can be challenge for any business communicator, but it is helpful to keep the end in mind.</p>

            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch02_s06_s06_p03">To improve communication, define your terms, choose precise words, consider your audience, control your tone, check for understanding, and aim for results.</p>
