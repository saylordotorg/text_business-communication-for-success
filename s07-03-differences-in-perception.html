    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_p01">Someone may say what you consider to be a simple exclamatory sentence—“Earn college credit while studying abroad!”—but a thought may come to mind: “How will I fit in as an outsider in a foreign country?” What makes you a member of a group? How you distinguish between those who belong in our family, group, or community and those who do not is central to our study of communication. Learning to see issues and experiences from multiple perspective can be a challenging task, but the effort is worth it. Increased understanding about each other can positively impact our communication and improve the degree to which we can share and understand meaning across languages, cultures, and divergent perspectives.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Don’t We All See Eye to Eye?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s01_p01">People perceive things differently. We choose to select different aspects of a message to focus our attention based on what interests us, what is familiar to us, or what we consider important. Often, our listening skills could use improvement. Listening and thinking are directly related. When you are reading, what do you hear? When you are talking with someone, what do you hear? If the sound of your thoughts or voice is at least one of your answers, then communication is not occurring. Try to read this paragraph again without interruption. Your tendency might be to skim over the words, or to focus on key vocabulary, but if you allow your thoughts to stray from the text you are reading, even for a moment, you are interrupting your processing of the written word, or reading. Interruptions will impair your ability to understand and retain information, and make studying even harder.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s01_p02">In order to better understand perception, we will examine how you choose to pay attention, remember, and interpret messages within the communication process.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Individual Differences in Perception</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_p01">Why do people perceive things in different ways? To answer the question, recall that we all engage in selection, or choosing some stimuli while ignoring others. We exist as individuals within a community, regardless of whether we are conscious of it. Do you like 80s music? Prefer the Beatles? Nothing before 2005? Your tastes in music involve the senses, and what you choose to experience is influenced by your context and environment. Your habits, values, and outlook on life are influenced by where you come from and where you are.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_p02">The attributes that cause people to perceive things differently are known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">individual differences</a><span class="glossdef">Attributes that cause different people to perceive things differently.</span></span>. Let’s examine several of the most important ones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_p03">Physical characteristics influence how we perceive and respond to information. You may be asked to design a sign that says, “Watch your head,” which will be placed next to a six foot six inch overhang that is above floor level. While a few very tall people will have to worry about hitting their heads on the overhang, most people in the world are not that tall. Tall and short individuals will perceive this sign differently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_p04">Your psychological state can also influence what you read and listen to, and why you do so. The emergency procedures binder on the wall next to the first aid kit doesn’t mean much to you until a coworker falls and suffers some bad cuts and bruises. If you were asked to design the binder and its contents, could you anticipate a psychological state of anxiety that would likely be present when someone needed the information? If so, then you might use clear bullet lists, concise, declarative sentences, and diagrams to communicate clearly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_p05">Your cultural background plays a significant role in what and how you perceive your world. You may be from a culture that values community. For example, the message across the advertisement reads: <em class="emphasis">Stand out from the crowd</em>. Given your cultural background, it may not be a very effective slogan to get your attention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_p06">Our perceptual set involves our attitudes, beliefs, and values about the world. Perhaps you’ve heard the phrase, “Looking at the world through rose-colored glasses” and can even think of someone as an example. We experience the world through mediated images and mass communication. We also come to know one another interpersonally in groups. All these experiences help form our mental expectations of what is happening and what will happen.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_p07">Think about your brand preferences, your choice of transportation, your self-expression through your clothing, haircut, and jewelry—all these external symbols represent in some way how you view yourself within your community and the world. We can extend this perspective in many ways, both positive and negative, and see that understanding the perspective of the audience takes on new levels of importance.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercises</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch03_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>When you watch a film with friends, make a point of talking about it afterward and listen to how each person perceived aspects of the film. Ask them each to describe it in ten words or less. Did they use the same words? Did you see it the same way, or differently? Did you catch all the points, frames of reference, values, or miss any information? What does this say about perception?</li>
                <li>Think of a time when you misunderstood a message. What was your psychological state at the time? Do you think you would have understood the message differently if you had been in a different psychological state?</li>
                <li>Think of a time when someone misunderstood your message. What happened and why? Share and compare with classmates.</li>
