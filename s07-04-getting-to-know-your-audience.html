    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_p01">Writing to your audience’s expectations is key to your success, but how do you get a sense of your readers? Research, time, and effort. At first glance you may think you know your audience, but if you dig a little deeper you will learn more about them and become a better speaker.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_p02">Examine <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch03_s04_f01">Figure 3.7 "Iceberg Model"</a>, often called the iceberg model. When you see an iceberg on the ocean, the great majority of its size and depth lie below your level of awareness. When you write a document or give a presentation, each person in your reading or listening audience is like the tip of an iceberg. You may perceive people of different ages, races, ethnicities, and genders, but those are only surface characteristics. This is your challenge. When you communicate with a diverse audience, you are engaging in intercultural communication. The more you learn about the audience, the better you will be able to navigate the waters, and your communication interactions, safely and effectively.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_p03">Theodore Roosevelt pointed out that “the most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people.” Knowing your audience well before you speak is essential. Here are a few questions to help guide you in learning more about your audience:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_l02">
        <li>How big is the audience?</li>
        <li>What are their backgrounds, gender, age, jobs, education, and/or interests?</li>
        <li>Do they already know about your topic? If so, how much?</li>
        <li>Will other materials be presented or available? If so, what are they, what do they cover, and how do they relate to your message?</li>
        <li>How much time is allotted for your presentation, or how much space do you have for your written document? Will your document or presentation stand alone or do you have the option of adding visuals, audio-visual aids, or links?</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Demographic Traits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Demographic traits</a><span class="glossdef">Characteristics that make someone an individual, but that he or she has in common with others.</span></span> refer to the characteristics that make someone an individual, but that he or she has in common with others. For example, if you were born female, then your view of the world may be different from that of a male, and may be similar to that of many other females. Being female means that you share this “femaleness” trait with roughly half the world’s population.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s01_p02">How does this demographic trait of being female apply to communication? For example, we might find that women tend to be more aware than the typical male of what it means to be capable of becoming pregnant, or to go through menopause. If you were giving a presentation on nutrition to a female audience, you would likely include more information about nutrition during pregnancy and during menopause than you would if your audience were male.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s01_p03">We can explore other traits by considering your audience’s age, level of education, employment or career status, and various other groups they may belong to. Imagine that you are writing a report on the health risks associated with smoking. To get your message across to an audience of twelve-year-olds, clearly you would use different language and different examples than what you would use for an audience of adults age fifty-five and older. If you were writing for a highly educated audience—say, engineering school graduates—you would use much more scholarly language and rigorous research documentation than if you were writing for first-year college students.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s01_p04">Writing for readers in the insurance industry, you would likely choose examples of how insurance claims are affected by whether or not a policyholder smokes, whereas if you were writing for readers who are athletes, you would focus on how the human body reacts to tobacco. Similarly, if you were writing for a community newsletter, you would choose local examples, whereas if your venue was a Web site for parents, you might choose examples that are more universal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s01_p05">Audiences tend to be interested in messages that relate to their interests, needs, goals, and motivations. Demographic traits can give us insight into our audience and allow for an audience-centered approach to your assignment that will make you a more effective communicator.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn03_018">Beebe, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s02_p01">The better you can understand your audience, the better you can tailor your communications to reach them. To understand them, a key step is to perceive clearly who they are, what they are interested in, what they need, and what motivates them. This ability to perceive is important with audience members from distinct groups, generations, and even cultures.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Fairness in Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s03_p01">Finally, consider that your audience has several expectations of you. No doubt you have sat through a speech or classroom lecture where you asked yourself, “Why should I listen?” You have probably been assigned to read a document or chapter and found yourself wondering, “What does this have to do with me?” These questions are normal and natural for audiences, but people seldom actually state these questions in so many words or say them out loud.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s03_p02">In a report on intercultural communication, V. Lynn Tyler<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn03_020">Tyler, V. (1978). Report of the working groups of the second SCA summer conference on intercultural communication. In N. C. Asuncio-Lande (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Ethical Perspectives and Critical Issues in Intercultural Communication</em> (pp. 170–177). Falls Church, VA: SCA.</span> offers us some insight into these audience expectations, which can be summarized as the need to be fair to your audience. One key fairness principle is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reciprocity</a><span class="glossdef">The mutual expectation for exchange of value or service.</span></span>, or a relationship of mutual exchange and interdependence. Reciprocity has four main components: mutuality, nonjudgmentalism, honesty, and respect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s03_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Mutuality</a><span class="glossdef">Searching for common ground and understanding with the audience.</span></span> means that the speaker searches for common ground and understanding with his or her audience, establishing this space and building on it throughout the speech. This involves examining viewpoints other than your own and taking steps to insure the speech integrates an inclusive, accessible format rather than an ethnocentric one.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s03_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nonjudgmentalism</a><span class="glossdef">Being open-minded; willing to examine diverse perspectives.</span></span> involves willingness to examine diverse ideas and viewpoints. A nonjudgmental communicator is open-minded, and able to accept ideas that may be strongly opposed to his or her own beliefs and values.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s03_p05">Another aspect of fairness in communication is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">honesty</a><span class="glossdef">Truthfulness; a key ingredient in trust.</span></span>: stating the truth as you perceive it. When you communicate honestly, you provide supporting and clarifying information and give credit to the sources where you obtained the information. In addition, if there is significant evidence opposing your viewpoint, you acknowledge this and avoid concealing it from your audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s03_p06">Finally, fairness involves <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">respect</a><span class="glossdef">Giving and displaying particular attention to the value you associate with someone or a group.</span></span> for the audience and individual members—recognizing that each person has basic rights and is worthy of courtesy. Consider these expectations of fairness when designing your message and you will more thoroughly engage your audience.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch03_s04_s03_p07">To better understand your audience, learn about their demographic traits, such as age, gender, and employment status, as these help determine their interests, needs, and goals. In addition, become aware of your perceptions and theirs, and practice fairness in your communications.</p>
