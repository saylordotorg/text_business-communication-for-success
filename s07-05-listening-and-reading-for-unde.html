    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_p01">As the popular author and Hollywood entrepreneur Wilson Mizner said, “A good listener is not only popular everywhere, but after a while he knows something.” Learning to listen to your conversational partner, customer, supplier, or supervisor is an important part of business communication. Too often, instead of listening we mentally rehearse what we want to say. Similarly, when we read, we are often trying to multitask and therefore cannot read with full attention. Inattentive listening or reading can cause us to miss much of what the speaker is sharing with us.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_p02">Communication involves the sharing and understanding of meaning. To fully share and understand, practice <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active listening and reading</a><span class="glossdef">Focusing your attention on the message you are hearing or reading, without distractions or interruptions.</span></span> so that you are fully attentive, fully present in the moment of interaction. Pay attention to both the actual words and for other clues to meaning, such as tone of voice or writing style. Look for opportunities for clarification and feedback when the time comes for you to respond, not before.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Active Listening and Reading</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s01_p01">You’ve probably experienced the odd sensation of driving somewhere and, having arrived, have realized you don’t remember driving. Your mind may have been filled with other issues and you drove on autopilot. It’s dangerous when you drive like that, and it is dangerous in communication. Choosing to listen or read attentively takes effort. People communicate with words, expressions, and even in silence, and your attention to them will make you a better communicator. From discussions on improving customer service to retaining customers in challenging economic times, the importance of listening comes up frequently as a success strategy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s01_p02">Here are some tips to facilitate active listening and reading:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Maintain eye contact with the speaker; if reading, keep your eyes on the page.</li>
            <li>Don’t interrupt; if reading, don’t multitask.</li>
            <li>Focus your attention on the message, not your internal monologue.</li>
            <li>Restate the message in your own words and ask if you understood correctly.</li>
            <li>Ask clarifying questions to communicate interest and gain insight.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">When the Going Gets Tough</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s02_p01">Our previous tips will serve you well in daily interactions, but suppose you have an especially difficult subject to discuss, or you receive a written document delivering bad news. In a difficult situation like this, it is worth taking extra effort to create an environment and context that will facilitate positive communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s02_p02">Here are some tips that may be helpful:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Set aside a special time</strong>. To have a difficult conversation or read bad news, set aside a special time when you will not be disturbed. Close the door and turn off the TV, music player, and instant messaging client.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t interrupt</strong>. Keep silent while you let the other person “speak his piece.” If you are reading, make an effort to understand and digest the news without mental interruptions.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be nonjudgmental</strong>. Receive the message without judgment or criticism. Set aside your opinions, attitudes, and beliefs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be accepting</strong>. Be open to the message being communicated, realizing that acceptance does not necessarily mean you agree with what is being said.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take turns</strong>. Wait until it is your turn to respond, and then measure your response in proportion to the message that was delivered to you. Reciprocal turn-taking allows each person have his say.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Acknowledge</strong>. Let the other person know that you have listened to the message or read it attentively.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Understand</strong>. Be certain that you understand what your partner is saying. If you don’t understand, ask for clarification. Restate the message in your own words.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your cool</strong>. Speak your truth without blaming. A calm tone will help prevent the conflict from escalating. Use “I” statements (e.g., “I felt concerned when I learned that my department is going to have a layoff”) rather than “you” statements (e.g., “you want to get rid of some of our best people”).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s02_p03">Finally, recognize that mutual respect and understanding are built one conversation at a time. Trust is difficult to gain and easy to lose. Be patient and keep the channels of communication open, as a solution may develop slowly over the course of many small interactions. Recognize that it is more valuable to maintain the relationship over the long term than to “win” in an individual transaction.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercises</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch03_s05_s02_l02">
                <li>Pair up with a classmate and do a role-play exercise in which one person tries to deliver a message while the other person multitasks and interrupts. Then try it again while the listener practices active listening. How do the two communication experiences compare? Discuss your findings.</li>
                <li>Select a news article and practice active reading by reading the article and summarizing each of its main points in your own words. Write a letter to the editor commenting on the article—you don’t have to send it, but you may if you wish.</li>
                <li>In a half-hour period of time, see if you can count how many times you are interrupted. Share and compare with your classmates.</li>
