        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s00_p01">Something we often hear in business is, “Get it in writing.” This advice is meant to prevent misunderstandings based on what one person thought the other person said. But does written communication—getting it in writing—always prevent misunderstandings?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s00_p02">According to a <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> news story, a written agreement would have been helpful to an airline customer named Mike. A victim of an airport mishap, Mike was given vouchers for $7,500 worth of free travel. However, in accordance with the airline’s standard policy, the vouchers were due to expire in twelve months. When Mike saw that he and his wife would not be able to do enough flying to use the entire amount before the expiration date, he called the airline and asked for an extension. He was told the airline would extend the deadline, but later discovered they were willing to do so at only 50 percent of the vouchers’ value. An airline spokesman told the newspaper, “If [Mike] can produce a letter stating that we would give the full value of the vouchers, he should produce it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_001">Oldenburg, D. (2005, April 12). Old adage holds: Get it in writing. <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, p. C10. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45309-2005Apr11.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45309-2005Apr11.html</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s00_p03">Yet, as we will see in this chapter, putting something in writing is not always a foolproof way to ensure accuracy and understanding. A written communication is only as accurate as the writer’s knowledge of the subject and audience, and understanding depends on how well the writer captures the reader’s attention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s00_p04">This chapter addresses the written word in a business context. We will also briefly consider the symbols, design, font, timing, and related nonverbal expressions you make when composing a page or document. Our discussions will focus on effective communication of your thoughts and ideas through writing that is clear, concise, and efficient.</p>
