            <li>Explain how reading, writing, and critical thinking contribute to becoming a good writer.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_p01">You may think that some people are simply born better writers than others, but in fact writing is a reflection of experience and effort. If you think about your successes as a writer, you may come up with a couple of favorite books, authors, or teachers that inspired you to express yourself. You may also recall a sense of frustration with your previous writing experiences. It is normal and natural to experience a sense of frustration at the <em class="emphasis">perceived</em> inability to express oneself. The emphasis here is on your perception of yourself as a writer as one aspect of how you communicate. Most people use oral communication for much of their self-expression, from daily interactions to formal business meetings. You have a lifetime of experience in that arena that you can leverage to your benefit in your writing. Reading out loud what you have written is a positive technique we’ll address later in more depth.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_p02">Martin Luther King Jr.’s statement, “Violence is the language of the unheard” emphasizes the importance of finding one’s voice, of being able to express one’s ideas. Violence comes in many forms, but is often associated with frustration born of the lack of opportunity to communicate. You may read King’s words and think of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, or perhaps of the violence of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, or of wars happening in the world today. Public demonstrations and fighting are expressions of voice, from individual to collective. Finding your voice, and learning to listen to others, is part of learning to communicate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_p03">You are your own best ally when it comes to your writing. Keeping a positive frame of mind about your journey as a writer is not a cliché or simple, hollow advice. Your attitude toward writing can and does influence your written products. Even if writing has been a challenge for you, the fact that you are reading this sentence means you perceive the importance of this essential skill. This text and our discussions will help you improve your writing, and your positive attitude is part of your success strategy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_p04">There is no underestimating the power of effort when combined with inspiration and motivation. The catch then is to get inspired and motivated. That’s not all it takes, but it is a great place to start. You were not born with a key pad in front of you, but when you want to share something with friends and text them, the words (or abbreviations) come almost naturally. So you recognize you have the skills necessary to begin the process of improving and harnessing your writing abilities for business success. It will take time and effort, and the proverbial journey starts with a single step, but don’t lose sight of the fact that your skillful ability to craft words will make a significant difference in your career.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reading</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s01_p01">Reading is one step many writers point to as an integral step in learning to write effectively. You may like Harry Potter books or be a Twilight fan, but if you want to write effectively in business, you need to read business-related documents. These can include letters, reports, business proposals, and business plans. You may find these where you work or in your school’s writing center, business department, or library; there are also many Web sites that provide sample business documents of all kinds. Your reading should also include publications in the industry where you work or plan to work, such as <em class="emphasis">Aviation Week</em>, <em class="emphasis">InfoWorld</em>, <em class="emphasis">Journal of Hospitality</em>, <em class="emphasis">International Real Estate Digest</em>, or <em class="emphasis">Women’s Wear Daily</em>, to name just a few. You can also gain an advantage by reading publications in fields other than your chosen one; often reading outside your niche can enhance your versatility and help you learn how other people express similar concepts. Finally, don’t neglect general media like the business section of your local newspaper, and national publications like the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, and the <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>. Reading is one of the most useful lifelong habits you can practice to boost your business communication skills.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s01_p02">In the “real world” when you are under a deadline and production is paramount, you’ll be rushed and may lack the time to do adequate background reading for a particular assignment. For now, take advantage of your business communication course by exploring common business documents you may be called on to write, contribute to, or play a role in drafting. Some documents have a degree of formula to them, and your familiarity with them will reduce your preparation and production time while increasing your effectiveness. As you read similar documents, take notes on what you observe. As you read several sales letters, you may observe several patterns that can serve you well later on when it’s your turn. These patterns are often called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conventions</a><span class="glossdef">Conventional language patterns for a specific genre.</span></span>, or conventional language patterns for a specific genre.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s02_p01">Never lose sight of one key measure of the effectiveness of your writing: the degree to which it fulfills readers’ expectations. If you are in a law office, you know the purpose of a court brief is to convince the judge that certain points of law apply to the given case. If you are at a newspaper, you know that an editorial opinion article is supposed to convince readers of the merits of a certain viewpoint, whereas a news article is supposed to report facts without bias. If you are writing ad copy, the goal is to motivate consumers to make a purchase decision. In each case, you are writing to a specific purpose, and a great place to start when considering what to write is to answer the following question: what are the readers’ expectations?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s02_p02">When you are a junior member of the team, you may be given clerical tasks like filling in forms, populating a database, or coordinating appointments. Or you may be assigned to do research that involves reading, interviewing, and note taking. Don’t underestimate these facets of the writing process; instead, embrace the fact that writing for business often involves tasks that a novelist might not even recognize as “writing.” Your contribution is quite important and in itself is an on-the-job learning opportunity that shouldn’t be taken for granted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s02_p03">When given a writing assignment, it is important to make sure you understand what you are being asked to do. You may read the directions and try to put them in your own words to make sense of the assignment. Be careful, however, not to lose sight of what the directions say versus what you think they say. Just as an audience’s expectations should be part of your consideration of how, what, and why to write, the instructions given by your instructor, or in a work situation by your supervisor, establish expectations. Just as you might ask a mentor more about a business writing assignment at work, you need to use the resources available to you to maximize your learning opportunity. Ask the professor to clarify any points you find confusing, or perceive more than one way to interpret, in order to better meet the expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s02_p04">Before you write an opening paragraph, or even the first sentence, it is important to consider the overall goal of the assignment. The word <em class="emphasis">assignment</em> can apply equally to a written product for class or for your employer. You might make a list of the main points and see how those points may become the topic sentences in a series of paragraphs. You may also give considerable thought to whether your word choice, your tone, your language, and what you want to say is in line with your understanding of your audience. We briefly introduced the writing process previously, and will visit it in depth later in our discussion, but for now writing should about exploring your options. Authors rarely have a finished product in mind when they start, but once you know what your goal is and how to reach it, you writing process will become easier and more effective.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Constructive Criticism and Targeted Practice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s03_p01">Mentors can also be important in your growth as a writer. Your instructor can serve as a mentor, offering constructive criticism, insights on what he or she has written, and life lessons about writing for a purpose. Never underestimate the mentors that surround you in the workplace, even if you are currently working in a position unrelated to your desired career. They can read your rough draft and spot errors, as well as provide useful insights. Friends and family can also be helpful mentors—if your document’s meaning is clear to someone not working in your business, it will likely also be clear to your audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s03_p02">The key is to be open to criticism, keeping in mind that no one ever improved by repeating bad habits over and over. Only when you know what your errors are—errors of grammar or sentence structure, logic, format, and so on—can you correct your document and do a better job next time. Writing can be a solitary activity, but more often in business settings it is a collective, group, or team effort. Keep your eyes and ears open for opportunities to seek outside assistance before you finalize your document.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s03_p03">Learning to be a successful business writer comes with practice. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Targeted practice</a><span class="glossdef">Identifying one’s weak areas and specifically working to improve them.</span></span>, which involves identifying your weak areas and specifically working to improve them, is especially valuable. In addition to reading, make it a habit to write, even if it is not a specific assignment. The more you practice writing the kinds of materials that are used in your line of work, the more writing will come naturally and become an easier task—even on occasions when you need to work under pressure.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Critical Thinking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Critical thinking</a><span class="glossdef">“Self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking.”</span></span> means becoming aware of your thinking process. It’s a human trait that allows us to step outside what we read or write and ask ourselves, “Does this really make sense?” “Are there other, perhaps better, ways to explain this idea?” Sometimes our thinking is very abstract and becomes clear only through the process of getting thoughts down in words. As a character in E. M. Forster’s <em class="emphasis">Aspects of the Novel</em> said, “How can I tell what I think till I see what I say?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_002">Forster, E. M. (1976). <em class="emphasis">Aspects of the novel</em> (p. 99). Oliver Stallybrass (Ed.). Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin.</span> Did you really write what you meant to, and will it be easily understood by the reader? Successful writing forms a relationship with the audience, reaching the reader on a deep level that can be dynamic and motivating. In contrast, when writing fails to meet the audience’s expectations, you already know the consequences: they’ll move on.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s04_p02">Learning to write effectively involves reading, writing, critical thinking, and hard work. You may have seen <em class="emphasis">The Wizard of Oz</em> and recall the scene when Dorothy discovers what is behind the curtain. Up until that moment, she believed the Wizard’s powers were needed to change her situation, but now she discovers that the power is her own. Like Dorothy, you can discover that the power to write successfully rests in your hands. Excellent business writing can be inspiring, and it is important to not lose that sense of inspiration as we deconstruct the process of writing to its elemental components.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s02_s04_p03">You may be amazed by the performance of Tony Hawk on a skateboard ramp, Mia Hamm on the soccer field, or Michael Phelps in the water. Those who demonstrate excellence often make it look easy, but nothing could be further from the truth. Effort, targeted practice, and persistence will win the day every time. When it comes to writing, you need to learn to recognize clear and concise writing while looking behind the curtain at how it is created. This is not to say we are going to lose the magic associated with the best writers in the field. Instead, we’ll appreciate what we are reading as we examine how it was written and how the writer achieved success.</p>
