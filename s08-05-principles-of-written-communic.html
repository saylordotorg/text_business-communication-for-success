        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch04_s05_l01">
            <li>Understand the rules that govern written language.</li>
            <li>Understand the legal implications of business writing.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_p01">You may not recall when or where you learned all about nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, articles, and phrases, but if you understand this sentence we’ll take for granted that you have a firm grasp of the basics. But even professional writers and editors, who have spent a lifetime navigating the ins and outs of crafting correct sentences, have to use reference books to look up answers to questions of grammar and usage that arise in the course of their work. Let’s examine how the simple collection of symbols called a word can be such a puzzle.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Words Are Inherently Abstract</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s01_p01">There is no universally accepted definition for love, there are many ways to describe desire, and there are countless ways to draw patience. Each of these terms is a noun, but it’s an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">abstract</a><span class="glossdef">Referring to an intangible concept.</span></span> noun, referring to an intangible concept.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s01_p02">While there are many ways to define a chair, describe a table, or draw a window, they each have a few common characteristics. A chair may be made from wood, crafted in a Mission style, or made from plastic resin in one solid piece in nondescript style, but each has four legs and serves a common function. A table and a window also have common characteristics that in themselves form a basis for understanding between source and receiver. The words “chair,” “table,” and “window” are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete terms</a><span class="glossdef">Describes something we can see and touch.</span></span>, as they describe something we can see and touch.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s01_p03">Concrete terms are often easier to agree on, understand, or at least define the common characteristics of. Abstract terms can easily become even more abstract with extended discussions, and the conversational partners may never agree on a common definition or even a range of understanding.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s01_p04">In business communication, where the goal is to be clear and concise, limiting the range of misinterpretation, which type of word do you think is preferred? Concrete terms serve to clarify your writing and more accurately communicate your intended meaning to the receiver. While all words are abstractions, some are more so than others. To promote effective communication, choose words that can be easily referenced and understood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Words Are Governed by Rules</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s02_p01">Perhaps you like to think of yourself as a free spirit, but did you know that all your communication is governed by rules? You weren’t born knowing how to talk, but learned to form words and sentences as you developed from infancy. As you learned language, you learned rules. You learned not only what a word means in a given context, and how to pronounce it; you also learned the social protocol of when to use it and when not to. When you write, your words represent you in your absence. The context may change from reader to reader, and your goal as an effective business communicator is to get your message across (and some feedback) regardless of the situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s02_p02">The better you know your audience and context, the better you can anticipate and incorporate the rules of how, what, and when to use specific words and terms. And here lies a paradox. You may think that, ideally, the best writing is writing that is universally appealing and understood. Yet the more you design a specific message to a specific audience or context, the less universal the message becomes. Actually, this is neither a good or bad thing in itself. In fact, if you didn’t target your messages, they wouldn’t be nearly as effective. By understanding this relationship of a universal or specific appeal to an audience or context, you can look beyond vocabulary and syntax and focus on the reader. When considering a communication assignment like a sales letter, knowing the intended audience gives you insight to the explicit and implicit rules.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s02_p03">All words are governed by rules, and the rules are vastly different from one language and culture to another. A famous example is the decision by Chevrolet to give the name “Nova” to one of its cars. In English, nova is recognized as coming from Latin meaning “new”; for those who have studied astronomy, it also refers to a type of star. When the Chevy Nova was introduced in Latin America, however, it was immediately ridiculed as the “car that doesn’t go.” Why? Because “<em class="emphasis">no va</em>” literally means “doesn’t go” in Spanish.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s02_p04">By investigating sample names in a range of markets, you can quickly learn the rules surrounding words and their multiple meaning, much as you learned about subjects and objects, verbs and nouns, adjectives and adverbs when you were learning language. Long before you knew formal grammar terms, you observed how others communicate and learned by trial and error. In business, error equals inefficiency, loss of resources, and is to be avoided. For Chevrolet, a little market research in Latin America would have gone a long way.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Words Shape Our Reality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s03_p01">Aristotle is famous for many things, including his questioning of whether the table you can see, feel, or use is real.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_007">Aristotle. (1941). De anima. In R. McKeon (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">The basic works of Aristotle</em> (J. A. Smith, Trans.). New York, NY: Random House.</span> This may strike you as strange, but imagine that we are looking at a collection of antique hand tools. What are they? They are made of metal and wood, but what are they used for? The words we use help us to make sense of our reality, and we often use what we know to figure out what we don’t know. Perhaps we have a hard time describing the color of the tool, or the table, as we walk around it. The light itself may influence our perception of its color. We may lack the vocabulary to accurately describe to the color, and instead say it is “like a” color, but not directly describe the color itself.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_008">Russell, B. (1962). <em class="emphasis">The problems of philosophy</em> (28th ed., p. 9). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. (Original work published 1912)</span> The color, or use of the tool, or style of the table are all independent of the person perceiving them, but also a reflection of the person perceiving the object.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s03_p02">In business communication, our goal of clear and concise communication involves anticipation of this inability to label a color or describe the function of an antique tool by constructing meaning. Anticipating the language that the reader may reasonably be expected to know, as well as unfamiliar terms, enables the writer to communicate in a way that describes with common reference points while illustrating the new, interesting, or unusual. Promoting understanding and limiting misinterpretations are key goals of the effective business communicator.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s03_p03">Your letter introducing a new product or service relies, to an extent, on your preconceived notions of the intended audience and their preconceived notions of your organization and its products or services. By referencing common ground, you form a connection between the known and the unknown, the familiar and the new. People are more likely to be open to a new product or service if they can reasonably relate it to one they are familiar with, or with which they have had good experience in the past. Your initial measure of success is effective communication, and your long term success may be measured in the sale or new contract for services.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Words and Your Legal Responsibility</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s04_p01">Your writing in a business context means that you represent yourself and your company. What you write and how you write it can be part of your company’s success, but can also expose it to unintended consequences and legal responsibility. When you write, keep in mind that your words will keep on existing long after you have moved on to other projects. They can become an issue if they exaggerate, state false claims, or defame a person or legal entity such as a competing company. Another issue is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">plagiarism</a><span class="glossdef">Representing another’s work as your own.</span></span>, using someone else’s writing without giving credit to the source. Whether the “cribbed” material is taken from a printed book, a Web site, or a blog, plagiarism is a violation of copyright law and may also violate your company policies. Industry standards often have legal aspects that must be respected and cannot be ignored. For the writer this can be a challenge, but it can be a fun challenge with rewarding results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s04_p02">The rapid pace of technology means that the law cannot always stay current with the realities of business communication. Computers had been in use for more than twenty years before Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, the first federal legislation to “move the nation’s copyright law into the digital age.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_009">United States Copyright Office (1998). Executive summary: Digital millennium copyright act. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmca_executive.html">http://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmca_executive.html</a></span> Think for a moment about the changes in computer use that have taken place since 1998, and you will realize how many new laws are needed to clarify what is fair and ethical, what should be prohibited, and who owns the rights to what.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s04_p03">For example, suppose your supervisor asks you to use your Facebook page or Twitter account to give an occasional “plug” to your company’s products. Are you obligated to comply? If you later change jobs, who owns your posts or tweets—are they yours, or does your now-former employer have a right to them? And what about your network of “friends”? Can your employer use their contact information to send marketing messages? These and many other questions remain to be answered as technology, industry practices, and legislation evolve.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_010">Tahmincioglu, E. (2009, October 11). Your boss wants you on Twitter: Companies recognizing value of having workers promote products. MSNBC Careers. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33090717/ns/business-careers">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33090717/ns/business-careers</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s04_p04">“Our product is better than X company’s product. Their product is dangerous and you would be a wise customer to choose us for your product solutions.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s04_p05">What’s wrong with these two sentences? They may land you and your company in court. You made a generalized claim of one product being better than another, and you stated it as if it were a fact. The next sentence claims that your competitor’s product is dangerous. Even if this is true, your ability to prove your claim beyond a reasonable doubt may be limited. Your claim is stated as fact again, and from the other company’s perspective, your sentences may be considered libel or defamation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s05_s04_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Libel</a><span class="glossdef">The written form of defamation, or a false statement that damages a reputation.</span></span> is the written form of defamation, or a false statement that damages a reputation. If a false statement of fact that concerns and harms the person defamed is published—including publication in a digital or online environment—the author of that statement may be sued for libel. If the person defamed is a public figure, they must prove malice or the intention to do harm, but if the victim is a private person, libel applies even if the offense cannot be proven to be malicious. Under the First Amendment you have a right to express your opinion, but the words you use and how you use them, including the context, are relevant to their interpretation as opinion versus fact. Always be careful to qualify what you write and to do no harm.</p>
