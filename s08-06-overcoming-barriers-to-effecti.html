            <li>Describe some common barriers to written communication and how to overcome them.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_p01">In almost any career or area of business, written communication is a key to success. Effective writing can prevent wasted time, wasted effort, aggravation, and frustration. The way we communicate with others both inside of our business and on the outside goes a long way toward shaping the organization’s image. If people feel they are listened to and able to get answers from the firm and its representatives, their opinion will be favorable. Skillful writing and an understanding of how people respond to words are central to accomplishing this goal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_p02">How do we display skillful writing and a good understanding of how people respond to words? Following are some suggestions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s01">

<em class="emphasis">Do</em> Sweat the Small Stuff</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s01_p01">Let us begin with a college student’s e-mail to a professor:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s01_p02">“i am confused as to why they are not due intil 11/10 i mean the calender said that they was due then so thats i did them do i still get credit for them or do i need to due them over on one tape? please let me know thanks. also when are you grading the stuff that we have done?”</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s01_p03">What’s wrong with this e-mail? What do you observe that may act as a barrier to communication? Let’s start with the lack of formality, including the fact that the student neglected to tell the professor his or her name, or which specific class the question referred to. Then there is the lack of adherence to basic vocabulary and syntax rules. And how about the lower case “i’s” and the misspellings?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s01_p04">One significant barrier to effective written communication is failure to sweat the small stuff. Spelling errors and incorrect grammar may be considered details, but they reflect poorly on you and, in a business context, on your company. They imply either that you are not educated enough to know you’ve made mistakes or that you are too careless to bother correcting them. Making errors is human, but making a habit of producing error-filled written documents makes negative consequences far more likely to occur. When you write, you have a responsibility to self-edit and pay attention to detail. In the long run, correcting your mistakes before others see them will take less time and effort than trying to make up for mistakes after the fact.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Get the Target Meaning</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p01">How would you interpret this message?</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p02">“You must not let inventory build up. You must monitor carrying costs and keep them under control. Ship any job lots of more than 25 to us at once.”</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bypassing</a><span class="glossdef">The misunderstanding that occurs when the receiver completely misses the source’s intended meaning.</span></span> involves the misunderstanding that occurs when the receiver completely misses the source’s intended meaning. Words mean different things to different people in different contexts. All that difference allows for both source and receiver to completely miss one another’s intended goal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p04">Did you understand the message in the example? Let’s find out. Jerry Sullivan, in his article <em class="emphasis">Bypassing in Managerial Communication</em>,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_011">Sullivan, J., Kameda, N., &amp; Nobu, T. (1991). Bypassing in managerial communication. <em class="emphasis">Business Horizons</em>, <em class="emphasis">34</em>(1), 71–80.</span> relates the story of Mr. Sato, a manager from Japan who is new to the United States. The message came from his superiors at Kumitomo America, a firm involved with printing machinery for the publishing business in Japan. Mr. Sato delegated the instructions (in English as shown above) to Ms. Brady, who quickly identified there were three lots in excess of twenty-five and arranged for prompt shipment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p05">Six weeks later Mr. Sato received a second message:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p06">“Why didn’t you do what we told you? Your quarterly inventory report indicates you are carrying 40 lots which you were supposed to ship to Japan. You must not violate our instructions.”</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p07">What’s the problem? As Sullivan relates, it is an example of one word, or set of words, having more than one meaning.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_012">Sullivan, J., Kameda, N., &amp; Nobu, T. (1991). Bypassing in managerial communication. <em class="emphasis">Business Horizons</em>, <em class="emphasis">34</em>(1), 71–80.</span> According to Sullivan, in Japanese “more than x” includes the reference number twenty-five. In other words, Kumitomo wanted all lots with twenty-five or more to be shipped to Japan. Forty lots fit that description. Ms. Brady interpreted the words as written, but the cultural context had a direct impact on the meaning and outcome.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p08">You might want to defend Ms. Brady and understand the interpretation, but the lesson remains clear. Moreover, cultural expectations differ not only internationally, but also on many different dimensions from regional to interpersonal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p09">Someone raised in a rural environment in the Pacific Northwest may have a very different interpretation of meaning from someone from New York City. Take, for example, the word “downtown.” To the rural resident, downtown refers to the center or urban area of any big city. To a New Yorker, however, downtown may be a direction, not a place. One can go uptown or downtown, but when asked, “Where are you from?” the answer may refer to a borough (“I grew up in Manhattan”) or a neighborhood (“I’m from the East Village”).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p10">This example involves two individuals who differ by geography, but we can further subdivide between people raised in the same state from two regions, two people of the opposite sex, or two people from different generations. The combinations are endless, as are the possibilities for bypassing. While you might think you understand, requesting feedback and asking for confirmation and clarification can help ensure that you get the target meaning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p11">Sullivan also notes that in stressful situations we often think in terms of either/or relationships, failing to recognize the stress itself. This kind of thinking can contribute to source/receiver error. In business, he notes that managers often incorrectly assume communication is easier than it is, and fail to anticipate miscommunication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn04_013">Sullivan, J., Kameda, N., &amp; Nobu, T. (1991). Bypassing in managerial communication. <em class="emphasis">Business Horizons</em>, <em class="emphasis">34</em>(1), 71–80.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s02_p12">As writers, we need to keep in mind that words are simply a means of communication, and that meanings are in people, not the words themselves. Knowing which words your audience understands and anticipating how they will interpret them will help you prevent bypassing.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Consider the Nonverbal Aspects of Your Message</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s03_p01">Let’s return to the example at the beginning of this section of an e-mail from a student to an instructor. As we noted, the student neglected to identify himself or herself and tell the instructor which class the question referred to. Format is important, including headers, contact information, and an informative subject line.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s03_p02">This is just one example of how the nonverbal aspects of a message can get in the way of understanding. Other nonverbal expressions in your writing may include symbols, design, font, and the timing of delivering your message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s03_p03">Suppose your supervisor has asked you to write to a group of clients announcing a new service or product that directly relates to a service or product that these clients have used over the years. What kind of communication will your document be? Will it be sent as an e-mail or will it be a formal letter printed on quality paper and sent by postal mail? Or will it be a tweet, or a targeted online ad that pops up when these particular clients access your company’s Web site? Each of these choices involves an aspect of written communication that is nonverbal. While the words may communicate a formal tone, <em class="emphasis">the font may not</em>. The paper chosen to represent your company influences the perception of it. An e-mail may indicate that it is less than formal and be easily deleted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s03_p04">As another example, suppose you are a small business owner and have hired a new worker named Bryan. You need to provide written documentation of asking Bryan to fill out a set of forms that are required by law. Should you send an e-mail to Bryan’s home the night before he starts work, welcoming him aboard and attaching links to IRS form W-4 and Homeland Security form I-9? Or should you wait until he has been at work for a couple of hours, then bring him the forms in hard copy along with a printed memo stating that he needs to fill them out? There are no right or wrong answers, but you will use your judgment, being aware that these nonverbal expressions are part of the message that gets communicated along with your words.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Review, Reflect, and Revise</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s04_p01">Do you review what you write? Do you reflect on whether it serves its purpose? Where does it miss the mark? If you can recognize it, then you have the opportunity to revise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s04_p02">Writers are often under deadlines, and that can mean a rush job where not every last detail is reviewed. This means more mistakes, and there is always time to do it right the second time. Rather than go through the experience of seeing all the mistakes in your “final” product and rushing off to the next job, you may need to focus more on the task at hand and get it done correctly the first time. Go over each step in detail as you review.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s04_p03">A mental review of the task and your performance is often called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reflection</a><span class="glossdef">A mental review of the task and your performance.</span></span>. Reflection is not procrastination. It involves looking at the available information and, as you review the key points in your mind, making sure each detail is present and perfect. Reflection also allows for another opportunity to consider the key elements and their relationship to each other.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s04_p04">When you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">revise</a><span class="glossdef">Change one word for another, make subtle changes, and improve a document.</span></span> your document, you change one word for another, make subtle changes, and improve it. Don’t revise simply to change the good work you’ve completed, but instead look at it from the perspective of the reader—for example, how could this be clearer to them? What would make it visually attractive while continuing to communicate the message? If you are limited to words only, then does each word serve the article or letter? No extras, but just about right.</p>

            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch04_s06_s04_p05">To overcome barriers to communication, pay attention to details; strive to understand the target meaning; consider your nonverbal expressions; and review, reflect, and revise.</p>
