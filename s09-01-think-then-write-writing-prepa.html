    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_p01">“How do I prepare myself for writing?” is a common question and one that has no single correct answer. When do you do your best work? Whatever your work or task may be, it doesn’t have to be writing. Some people work best in the morning, others only after their daily dose of coffee. Still others burn the midnight oil and work well late into the night while their colleagues lose their productive edge as the sun sets. “To thine own self be true,” is a great idea when you have the freedom to choose when you work, but increasingly our lives are governed by schedules and deadlines that we do not control. You may have a deadline that requires you to work late at night when you recognize that you are far more productive early in the morning. If you can, consider one important step to writing success: know when you are most productive. If you cannot choose your timing, then dedication and perseverance are required. The job must be completed and the show must go on. Your effort demonstrates self-control and forbearance (as opposed to impatience and procrastination) and implies professionalism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_p02">To be productive, you have to be alert, ready to work, and can accomplish tasks with relative ease. You will no doubt recognize that sometimes tasks take a lot longer, the solution is much harder to find, and you may find work more frustrating at other times. If you have the option, try to adjust your schedule so the writing tasks before you can be tackled at times when you are most productive, where you ability to concentrate is best, and when you are your most productive. If you don’t have the option, focus clearly on the task before you.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_p03">Every individual is different, and what works for one person may be ineffective for someone else. One thing that professional writers agree on, however, is that you don’t need to be in the “right mood” to write—and that, in fact, if you wait for the right mood to strike, you will probably never get started at all. Ernest Hemingway, who wrote some of the most famous novels of the twentieth century as well as hundreds of essays, articles, and short stories, advised writers to “work every day. No matter what has happened the day or night before, get up and bite on the nail.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_001">Hemingway, E. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Ernest Hemingway on writing</em> (L. W. Phillips, Ed.). New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster Adult Publishing Group.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_p04">In order for your work to be productive, you will need to focus your attention on your writing. The stereotype of the writer tucked away in an attic room or a cabin in the woods, lost in the imaginary world created by the words as they flow onto the page, is only a stereotype. Our busy lives involve constant interruption. In a distraction-prone business environment, much of your writing will be done while colleagues are talking on the phone, having face-to-face conversations as they walk by, and possibly stopping at your desk to say hello or ask a question. Your phone may ring or you may have incoming instant messages (IMs) that need to be answered quickly. These unavoidable interruptions make it even more important to develop a habit of concentrating when you write.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_p05">The mind has been likened to a brace of wild horses; if you have ever worked with horses, you know they each have a mind of their own. Taken individually they can be somewhat manageable, but together they can prove to be quite a challenge. Our minds can multitask and perform several tasks simultaneously, but we can also get easily distracted. We can get sidetracked and lose valuable time away from our designated task. Our ability to concentrate is central to our ability to write effectively, whether we work alone or as part of a team.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_p06">In many business situations, you may not be writing solo but instead collaborating on a document with various coworkers, vendors, or customers. The ability to concentrate is perhaps even more important in these group writing situations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_002">Nickerson, R. S., Perkins, D. N., &amp; Smith, E. E. (1985). <em class="emphasis">The teaching of thinking</em>. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erbaum Associates.</span> In this discussion, we’ll consider the writing process from a singular perspective, where you are personally responsible for planning, researching, and producing a product of writing. In other areas of this text we also consider the collaborative process, its strengths and weaknesses, and how to negotiate and navigate the group writing process.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Thinking Critically</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s01_p01">As you approach your writing project, it is important to practice the habit of thinking critically. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Critical thinking</a><span class="glossdef">“Self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking.”</span></span> can be defined as “self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_003">Paul, R., &amp; Elder, L. (2007). <em class="emphasis">The miniature guide to critical thinking: Concepts and tools</em>. Dillon Beach, CA: The Foundation for Critical Thinking Press.</span> It is the difference between watching television in a daze versus analyzing a movie with attention to its use of lighting, camera angles, and music to influence the audience. One activity requires very little mental effort, while the other requires attention to detail, the ability to compare and contrast, and sharp senses to receive all the stimuli.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s01_p02">As a habit of mind, critical thinking requires established standards and attention to their use, effective communication, problem solving, and a willingness to acknowledge and address our own tendency for confirmation bias, egocentrism, and sociocentrism. We’ll use the phrase “habit of mind” because clear, critical thinking is a habit that requires effort and persistence. People do not start an exercise program, a food and nutrition program, or a stop-smoking program with 100 percent success the first time. In the same way, it is easy to fall back into lazy mental short cuts, such as “If it costs a lot, it must be good,” when in fact the statement may very well be false. You won’t know until you gather information that supports (or contradicts) the assertion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s01_p03">As we discuss getting into the right frame of mind for writing, keep in mind that the same recommendations apply to reading and research. If you only pay attention to information that reinforces your existing beliefs and ignore or discredit information that contradicts your beliefs, you are guilty of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">confirmation bias</a><span class="glossdef">When you only pay attention to information that reinforces your existing beliefs, and ignore or discredit information that contradicts your beliefs.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_004">Gilovich, T. (1993). <em class="emphasis">How we know what isn’t so: The fallibility of human reason in everyday life</em>. New York, NY: The Free Press.</span> As you read, research, and prepare for writing, make an effort to gather information from a range of reliable sources, whether or not this information leads to conclusions you didn’t expect. Remember that those who read your writing will be aware of, or have access to, this universe of data as well and will have their own confirmation bias. Reading and writing from an audience-centered view means acknowledging your confirmation bias and moving beyond it to consider multiple frames of references, points of view, and perspectives as you read, research, and write.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s01_p04">Egocentrism and sociocentrism are related concepts to confirmation bias. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Egocentrism</a><span class="glossdef">The use of self-centered standards to determine what to believe and what to reject.</span></span> can be defined as the use of self-centered standards to determine what to believe and what to reject. Similarly, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sociocentrism</a><span class="glossdef">Involves the use of society-centered standards.</span></span> involves the use of society-centered standards.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_005">Paul, R., &amp; Elder, L. (2007). <em class="emphasis">The miniature guide to critical thinking: Concepts and tools</em>. Dillon Beach, CA: The Foundation for Critical Thinking Press.</span> Both ways of thinking create an “us versus them” relationship that can undermine your credibility and alienate readers who don’t share your viewpoint.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s01_p05">This leads to confirmation bias and groupthink, resulting in false conclusions with little or no factual support for a belief. If a person believes the earth is flat and never questions that belief, it serves as an example of egocentric thinking. The person believes it is true even though he has never questioned why he believes it. If the person decides to look for information but only finds information that supports his pre-existing belief, ignoring or discrediting information that contradicts that belief, he is guilty of confirmation bias. If he believes the earth is flat because everyone in his group or community believes it, even though he himself has never questioned or confirmed the belief, he is guilty of sociocentrism.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s01_p06">In each case, the false thinking strategy leads to poor conclusions. Watch out for your tendency to read, write, and believe that which reflects only what you think you know without solid research and clear, critical thinking.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Overcoming Fear of Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_p01">For many people, one of the most frightening things in life is public speaking. For similar reasons, whether rational or irrational, writing often generates similar fears. There is something about exposing one’s words to possible criticism that can be truly terrifying. In this chapter, we are going to break down the writing process into small, manageable steps that, in turn, will provide you with a platform for success. To take advantage of these steps, you need to acknowledge any reluctance or fear that may be holding you back, and bring your interests and enthusiasm to this discussion on writing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_p02">Having a positive attitude about writing in general, and your effort, is also a key ingredient to your success. If you approach a writing assignment with trepidation and fear, you will spend your valuable time and attention in ways that do not contribute positively to your writing. People often fear the writing process because of three main reasons:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Negative orientation</li>
            <li>Risk of failure</li>
            <li>Fear of the unknown</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_p03">Let’s take each reason in turn. Negative orientation means the writer has a pre-existing negative association or view of the task or activity. We tend to like people who like us,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_006">Gudykunst, W. B., &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (1997). <em class="emphasis">Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication</em> (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</span> tend to pursue activities where we perceive rewards and appreciation for our efforts, and are more likely to engage in activities where we perceive we are successful. Conversely, we tend to not like people who we perceive as not like us, tend to ignore or avoid activities where we perceive we are not appreciated or are not rewarded, and are less likely to engage in activities where we perceive we are not successful. For some writers, previous experiences have led to a pre-existing association with writing. That association may be positive if they have been encouraged, affirmed, or rewarded as they demonstrated measurable gain. That association may also be negative if efforts have been met with discouraging feedback, a lack of affirmation, or negative reinforcement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_p04">Effective business writing is a highly valued skill, and regardless of the degree to which writing will be a significant aspect of your designated job duties, your ability to do it well will be a boost to your career. If you have a negative orientation toward writing, admitting this fact is an important first step. Next, we need to actively seek ways to develop your skills in ways that will demonstrate measurable gain and lead to positive affirmation. Not everyone develops in the same way on the same schedule, and measurable gain means that from one writing assignment to the next you can demonstrate positive progress. In an academic setting, measurable gain is one of your clear goals as a writer. In a business or industry setting, you may lack the time to revise and improve, meaning that you will need to get it right the first time. Take advantage of the academic setting to set positive, realistic goals to improve your writing. Surround yourself with resources, including people who will help you reach your goal. If your college or university has a writing center, take advantage of it. If it does not, seek out assistance from those whose writing has been effective and well received.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_p05">It is a given that you do not want to fail. Risk of failure is a common fear across public speaking and writing situations, producing predictable behavioral patterns we can recognize, address, and resolve. In public speaking, our minds may go blank at the start of a presentation as we confront our fear of failure. In writing, we may experience a form of blankness often referred to as “writer’s block”—the overwhelming feeling of not knowing what to write or where to start—and sit helplessly waiting for our situation to change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_p06">But we have the power to change our circumstances and to overcome our risk of failure. You may be familiar with the concept of a rough draft, but it may compete in your mind with a desire for perfection. Writing is a dynamic process, a reflection of the communication process itself. It won’t be perfect the first time you attempt it. Awareness that your rough draft serves a purpose, but doesn’t represent your final product, should serve in the same way a rehearsal for a speech serves a speaker. You get a second (or third) chance to get it right. Use this process to reduce your fear of failure and let go of your perfectionist tendencies, if only for a moment. Your desire for perfection will serve you well when it comes to polishing your finished document, but everything has its time and place. Learning where and when to place your effort is part of writing preparation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s01_s02_p07">Finally, we often fear the unknown. It is part of being human, and is reflected across all contexts, including public speaking and writing. If you have never given a speech before, your first time on stage can be quite an ordeal. If you have never written a formal business report, your fear of the unknown is understandable. How can you address this fear? Make the unknown known. If we take the mystery out of the process and product, we can see it for its essential components, its organizational pattern, and start to see how our product may look before we even start to produce it. In many organizations, you can ask your supervisor or coworkers for copies of similar documents to the one you have been assigned, even if the content is quite different. If this is not an option, simply consider the way most documents in your company are written—even something as basic as an interoffice e-mail will provide some clues. Your goal is to become familiar with the type of document and to examine several successful examples. Once you see a couple of reports, you will have a better feel for what you have to produce and the unknown will be far less mysterious.</p>
