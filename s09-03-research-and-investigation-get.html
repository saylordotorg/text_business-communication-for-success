<span class="title-prefix">5.3</span> Research and Investigation: Getting Started</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch05_s03_l01">
            <li>Compare and contrast ways of knowing your reading audience.</li>
            <li>Conduct research and investigation to gather information.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_p01">Clearly, not every piece of business writing requires research or investigation. If you receive an e-mail asking for the correct spelling of your boss’s name and her official title, you will probably be able to answer without having to look anything up. But what if the sender of the e-mail wants to know who in your company is the decision maker for purchasing a certain supply item? Unless you work for a very small company, you will likely have to look through the organizational chart, and possibly make a phone call or two, before you are able to write an e-mail answering this question. There—you have just done the research for a piece of business writing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_p02">Even if you need to write something much more complex than an e-mail, such as a report or proposal, research does not have to be all about long hours at a library. Instead, start by consulting with business colleagues who have written similar documents and ask what worked, what didn’t work, what was well received by management and the target audience. Your efforts will need to meet similar needs. Your document will not stand alone but will exist within a larger agenda. How does your proposed document fit within this agenda at your place of work, within the larger community, or with the target audience? It’s worth noting that the word “investigation” contains the word “invest.” You will need to invest your time and effort to understand the purpose and goal of your proposed document.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_p03">Before you go to the library, look over the information sources you already have in hand. Do you regularly read a magazine that relates to the topic? Was there an article in the newspaper you read that might work? Is there a book, CD-ROM or mp3 that has information you can use? Think of what you want the audience to know and how you could show it to them. Perhaps a famous quote or a line from a poem may make an important contribution to your document. You might even know someone that has experience in the area you want to research, someone who has been involved with skydiving locally for his or her whole life. Consider how you are going to tell and show your audience what your document is all about.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_p04">Once you have an assignment or topic, know your general and specific purposes, and have good idea of your reader’s expectations, it’s time to gather information. Your best sources may be all around you, within your business or organization. Information may come from reports from the marketing department or even from a trusted and well-versed colleague, but you will still need to do your homework. After you have written several similar documents for your organization, you may have your collection of sample documents, but don’t be tempted to take shortcuts and “repurpose” existing documents to meet a tight deadline. Creating an original work specifically tailored to the issue and audience at hand is the best approach to establish credibility, produce a more effective document, and make sure no important aspect of your topic is left out.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Narrowing Your Topic</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s01_p01">By now you have developed an idea of your topic, but even with a general and specific purpose, you may still have a broad subject that will be a challenge to cover within the allotted time before the deadline. You might want to revisit your purpose and ask yourself, how specific is my topic?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s01_p02">Imagine that you work for a local skydiving training facility. Your boss has assembled a list of people who might be candidates for skydiving and asks you to write a letter to them. Your general purpose is to persuade, and your specific purpose is to increase the number of students enrolled in classes. You’ve decided that skydiving is your topic area and you are going to tell your audience how exhilarating the experience is, discuss the history and basic equipment, cover the basic requirements necessary to go on a first jump, and provide reference information on where your audience could go to learn more (links and Web sites, for example).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s01_p03">But at this point you might find that a one-page letter simply is not enough space for the required content. Rather than expand the letter to two pages and risk losing the reader, consider your audience and what they might want to learn. How can you narrow your topic to better consider their needs? As you edit your topic, considering what the essential information is and what can be cut, you’ll come to focus on the key points naturally and reduce the pressure on yourself to cover too much information in a limited space environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s01_p04">Perhaps starting with a testimony about a client’s first jump, followed by basic equipment and training needed, and finally a reference to your organization may help you define your document. While the history may be fascinating, and may serve as a topic in itself for another day, it may add too much information in this persuasive letter. Your specific purpose may be to increase enrollment, but your general goal will be to communicate goodwill and establish communication. If you can get your audience to view skydiving in a positive light and consider the experience for themselves, or people they know, you have accomplished your general purpose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Focus on Key Points</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s02_p01">As a different example, let’s imagine that you are the office manager for a pet boarding facility that cares for dogs and cats while their owners are away. The general manager has asked you to draft a memo to remind employees about safety practices. Your general purpose is twofold: to inform employees about safety concerns and to motivate them to engage in safe work practices. Your specific purpose is also twofold: to prevent employees from being injured or infected with diseases on the job, and to reduce the risk of the animal patients being injured or becoming sick while in your care.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s02_p02">You are an office manager, not a veterinary or medical professional, and clearly there are volumes written about animal injuries and illnesses, not to mention entire schools devoted to teaching medicine to doctors who care for human patients. In a short memo you cannot hope to cover all possible examples of injury or illness. Instead, focus on the following behaviors and situations you observe:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Do employees wash their hands thoroughly before and after contact with each animal?</li>
            <li>Are hand-washing facilities kept clean and supplied with soap and paper towels?</li>
            <li>When cleaning the animals’ cages, do employees wear appropriate protection such as gloves?</li>
            <li>What is the procedure for disposing of animal waste, and do all employees know and follow the procedure?</li>
            <li>When an animal is being transferred from one cage to another, are there enough staff members present to provide backup assistance in case the animal becomes unruly?</li>
            <li>What should an employee do if he or she is bitten or scratched?</li>
            <li>What if an animal exhibits signs of being ill?</li>
            <li>Have there been any recent incidents that raised concerns about safety?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s02_p03">Once you have posed and answered questions like these, it should be easier to narrow down the information so that the result is a reasonably brief, easy to read memo that will get employees’ attention and persuade them to adopt safe work practices.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Planning Your Investigation for Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s03_p01">Now let’s imagine that you work for a small accounting firm whose president would like to start sending a monthly newsletter to clients and prospective clients. He is aware of newsletter production service vendors that provide newsletters to represent a particular accounting firm. He has asked you to compile a list of such services, their prices and practices, so that the firm can choose one to employ.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s03_p02">If you are alert, you will begin your planning immediately, while your conversation with the president is still going on, as you will need more information before you can gauge the scope of the assignment. Approximately how many newsletter vendors does your president want to know about—is three or four enough? Would twenty be too many? Is there a set budget figure that the newsletter cost must not exceed? How soon does your report need to be done?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s03_p03">Once you have these details, you will be able to plan when and where to gather the needed information. The smartest place to begin is right in your office. If the president has any examples of newsletters he has seen from other businesses, you can examine them and note the contact information of the companies that produced them. You may also have an opportunity to ask coworkers if they know or even have copies of any such newsletters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s03_p04">Assuming that your president wants to consider more than just a couple of vendors, you will need to expand your search. The next logical place to look is the Internet. In some companies, employees have full Internet access from their office computers; other companies provide only a few terminals with Internet access. Some workplaces allow no Internet access; if this is the case, you can visit your nearest public library.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s03_p05">As anyone who has spent an entire evening aimlessly Web surfing can attest, the Internet is a great place to find loads and loads of interesting but irrelevant information. Knowing what questions you are seeking to answer will help you stay focused on your report’s topic, and knowing the scope of the report will help you to decide how much research time to plan in your schedule.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Staying Organized</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_p01">Once you open up a Web browser such as Google and type in a search parameter like “newsletter production,” you will have a wealth of information to look at. Much of it may be irrelevant, but even the information that fits with your project will be so much that you will be challenged to keep track of it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_p02">Perhaps the most vital strategy for staying organized while doing online research is to open a blank page in your word processor and title it “Sources.” Each time you find a Web page that contains what you believe may be useful and relevant information, copy the URL and paste it on this Sources page. Under the URL, copy and paste a paragraph or two as an example of the information you found on this Web page. Err on the side of listing too many sources; if in doubt about a source, list it for the time being—you can always discard it later. Having these source URLs and snippets of information all in one place will save you a great deal of time and many headaches later on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_p03">As you explore various Web sites of companies that provide newsletter production services, you will no doubt encounter new questions that your president did not answer in the original conversation:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>Does the newsletter need to be printed on paper and mailed? Or would an e-mail newsletter be acceptable, or even preferable?</li>
            <li>Does your firm want the newsletter vendor to write all of the content customized to your firm, provide a menu of pre-existing articles for your firm to choose from, or let your firm provide some—or even all—of the content?</li>
            <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of these various options?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_p04">You also realize that in order to get any cost estimates, even when the above questions are settled, you will need to know the desired length of the newsletter (in pages or in words), and how many recipients are on your firm’s mailing list. At this point in your research and investigation, it may make sense to give your president an informal interim report, summarizing what you have found out and what additional questions need to be answered.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_p05">Having a well-organized list of the information you have assembled, the new questions that have arisen, and the sources where you found your information will allow you to continue researching effectively as soon as you have gotten answers and more specific direction from your president.</p>
        <div class="key_takeaways editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_p06">To make a writing project manageable, narrow your topic, focus on key points, plan your investigation for information, and stay organized as you go along.</p>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch05_s03_s04_l02">
                <li>Think of a time when someone asked you to gather information to make a decision, whether for work, school, or in your personal life. How specific was the request? What did you need to know before you could determine how much and what kind of information to gather? Discuss your answer with those of your classmates.</li>
                <li>Make a list of all the ways you procrastinate, noting how much time is associated with each activity or distraction. Share and compare your results with a classmate.</li>
                <li>You are the manager. Write an e-mail requesting an employee to gather specific information on a topic. Give clear directions and due date(s). Please share your results with the class.</li>
                <li>How do you prepare yourself for a writing project? How do others? What strategies work best for you? Survey ten colleagues or coworkers and compare your results with your classmates.</li>
