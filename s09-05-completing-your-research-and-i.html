    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_p01">Once you become immersed in your sources, it can be easy to get carried away in the pursuit of information and lose sight of why you are doing all this research and investigation. As a responsible writer, you will need to plan not only how you will begin your information gathering, but also how you will bring it to a conclusion.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Your Time</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s01_p01">Given the limited time for research involved in most business writing, how can you make the most of your information-gathering efforts? Part of learning to write effectively involves learning to read quickly and efficiently while conducting research. You are not required to read each word, and if you did, you would slow yourself down greatly. At the same time, if you routinely skip large sections of print and only focus on the bullet lists, you may miss valuable examples that could inspire you in your writing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s01_p02">How can you tell when to skim and when to pay attention to detail? One strategy is to look for abstracts (or brief summaries of information) before you commit time to reading an article all the way through. Look for indexes to identify key terms you might want to cover before eliminating them as you narrow your topic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s01_p03">As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, it is smart to make a list of your sources as you search; you may also want to bookmark pages with you Web browser. Sometimes a source that does not look very promising may turn out to offer key information that will drive home an important point in your document. If you have done a good job of recording your sources, it will be easy to go back to a site or source that at first you passed over, but now think may make a relevant contribution.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Compiling Your Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p01">Patricia Andrews, James Andrews, and Glen Williams<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_011">Andrews, P. H., Andrews, J., &amp; Williams, G. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Public speaking: Connecting you and your audience</em>.

This process has seven major steps, adapted from the Andrews, Andrews, and Williams<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_012">Andrews, P. H., Andrews, J., &amp; Williams, G. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Public speaking: Connecting you and your audience</em>. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company.</span> model, which we will consider: sensitivity, exposure, assimilation and accommodation, incubation, incorporation, production and revision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p02">Let’s say your letter introducing skydiving to a new audience was relatively successful and the regional association asks you to write a report on the status of skydiving services in your region, with the hope that the comprehensive guide may serve to direct and enhance class enrollment across the region. Your task has considerably expanded and involves more research, but given the opportunity this assignment presents, you are excited at the challenge. As you begin to research, plan, and design the document, you will touch on the process of compiling information. If you are aware of each step, your task can be accomplished effectively and efficiently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sensitivity</a><span class="glossdef">Your capacity to respond to stimulation, be excited, be responsive, or be susceptible to new information.</span></span> refers to your capacity to respond to stimulation, being excited, responsive or susceptible to new information. This starts with a self-inventory of your current or past interests and activities. If you are intrigued by a topic or area of interest, your enthusiasm will carry through to your document and make it more stimulating for your reading audience. You may not have considered, or even noticed elements or ideas associated with your topic, but now that you have begun the process of investigation, you see them everywhere. For example, have you ever heard someone say a word or phrase that you never heard before, but now that you are familiar with it, you hear it everywhere? This same principle applies to your sensitivity to ideas related to your topic. You’ll notice information and it will help you as you develop your awareness of your topic and the many directions you could take the speech. Cognitive psychologist use the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priming</a><span class="glossdef">An excited state of awareness.</span></span> to refer to this excited state of awareness.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn05_013">Yaniv, I., &amp; Meyer, D. (1987). Activation and metacognition of inaccessible stored information: potential bases for incubation effects in problem loving. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 13</em>, 187–205.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Exposure</a><span class="glossdef">Involves your condition of being presented with views, ideas, experiences, or made known to you through direct experience.</span></span> involves your condition of being presented views, ideas, or experiences made known to you through direct experience. If you are going to select a topic on flying but have never flown before, your level of exposure may be low. Your level of awareness may be high, however, in terms of the importance of security on airplanes after reading about, watching on television, or hearing on the radio stories after the events of September 11, 2001. You may decide to expose yourself to more information through a range of sources as you investigate the topic of airline security. And the more you become exposed to the issues, processes, and goals of your topic, the more likely you are to see areas of interest, new ideas that might fit in your speech, and form patterns of awareness you did not perceive earlier. We have previously discussed at length the importance of selection as a stage in the perceptual process, and selective exposure is one way you gain awareness. You may want to revisit this chapter as you develop your topic or choose where to look for information or decide what kinds of information to expose yourself to as you research your topic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Assimilation</a><span class="glossdef">The process by which you integrate new ideas into your thinking patterns.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accommodation</a><span class="glossdef">The process by which you adapt or filter out new sources of information as they relate to your goal.</span></span> refer to the processes by which you assimilate (or integrate) new ideas into your thinking patterns and accommodate (or adopt, adapt, or filter out) new sources of information as they relate to your goal. You may have had preconceived notions or ideas about airline security before you began your investigation, but new information has changed the way you view your topic. You might also find issues (e.g., right to privacy) that may be points of conflict with your beliefs as you review information. This stage is important to the overall process of developing your topic, and it takes time. You need time to be able to contemplate, review, and reflect on how the new information fits or fails to connect clearly to your chosen topic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Incubation</a><span class="glossdef">The process by which you cause an idea or ideas to develop in your mind.</span></span> is the process by which you cause an idea or ideas to develop in your mind. This might not happen all at once, and you might spend time thinking about the new information, directions, or ways you might develop or focus your topic. Consider the meaning of the word as it relates to chickens and eggs. An egg may be produced, but it needs time and a warm environment to develop. You might have an idea, but you need to create an environment for it to develop. This might involve further investigation and exploration, or it may involve removing yourself from active research to “digest” or “incubate” what you have already learned. You may feel stuck on an idea or perceive an inability to move on in the development of your ideas or topic, and giving it a rest may be the best course of action. You may also find that just when you least expect it, an idea, fully formed, flashes in your mind and you think, “Why didn’t I see that before?” Before the idea escapes you, write it down and make sure you can refer to it later.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p07"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Incorporation</a><span class="glossdef">The process by which you bring the information into a whole or complete topic.</span></span> refers to the process by which you bring the information into a whole or complete topic. By now you have investigated, chosen some information over others, and have started to see how the pieces will come together. Your perceptions of how the elements come together will form the basis for your development of the organization of your document. It will contribute to the <em class="emphasis">logos</em>, or logic, of your thought and its representation in your document, and help you produce a coherent, organized message that your audience can follow clearly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p08"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Production</a><span class="glossdef">Involves the act of creating your speech from the elements you have gathered; you may start to consider what comes first, what goes last, and how you will link your ideas and examples together.</span></span> involves the act of creating your document from the elements you have gathered. You may start to consider what comes first, what goes last, and how you will link your ideas and examples together. You may find that you need additional information and need to go back to your notes that you have taken to find the source quickly and easily. You may also start to communicate with friends, sharing some of the elements or even practicing the first drafts of your document, learning where the connections are clear and where they need work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p09"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Revision</a><span class="glossdef">The process by which you look over your speech again in order to correct or improve it.</span></span> is the process by which you look over again in order to correct or improve your message. You will notice elements that need further investigation, development, or additional examples and visual aids as you produce your document. This is an important step to the overall production of your message, much like revising an essay for an English course. The first time you said, thought, or wrote something it may have made sense to you, but upon reflection and after trying an idea out, you need it to be revised in order to work effectively as part of your document. You may revisit the place in which you started (and start all speeches) by reconsidering the rhetorical situation and see if what you have produces is in line with the expectations of the audience. Your awareness of the content, audience, and purpose of the rhetorical situation will guide you through the revision process and contribute to the production of a more effective document.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p10">Once you have gathered what you think is enough material—or, perhaps, once your eyes begin to glaze over—take a step back and return to the general and specific purpose of the document you set out to write. Look again at the basic elements (i.e., who, what, when, etc.) and fill in the “answers” based on what you have found. It is not unusual at this stage to have some “holes” in the information that require more research to fill. You may also realize that your research findings have disproved part or even all of your original agenda, making it necessary to change your message significantly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p11">Leave enough time before your deadline so that you can sketch out a detailed outline and rough draft of your document and leave it alone for at least a day. When you look at it again, it will probably be clear which additional details need more support, and you can perform targeted research to fill in those gaps.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch05_s05_s02_p12">Be mindful of your result and your time frame as you conduct your research and investigation. Allow enough time to let the writing rest before you return to it and make revisions.</p>
