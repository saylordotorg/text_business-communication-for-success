            <li>Understand how to develop and organize content in patterns that are appropriate for your document and audience.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate your ability to order, outline, and emphasize main points in one or more written assignments.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_p01">The purpose of business writing is to communicate facts and ideas. In order to accomplish that purpose, each document has key components that need to be present in order for your reading audience to understand the message. These elements may seem simple to the point that you may question how any writer could neglect them. But if you take note of how often miscommunication and misunderstanding happen, particularly in written communications, you will realize that it happens all the time. Omission or neglect may be intentional, but it is often unintentional; the writer assumes (wrongly) that the reader will easily understand a concept, idea, or the meaning of the message. From background to language, culture to education, there are many variables that come into play and make effective communication a challenge. The degree to which you address these basic elements will increase the effectiveness of your documents. Each document must address the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_l02">
        <li>Who</li>
        <li>What</li>
        <li>When</li>
        <li>Where</li>
        <li>How</li>
        <li>(and sometimes) Why</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_p02">If you have these elements in mind as you prepare your document, it will be easier to decide what to write and in what order. They will also be useful when you are reviewing your document before delivering it. If your draft omits any one of these elements or addresses it in an unclear fashion, you will know what you need to do to fix it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_p03">Another way to approach organizing your document is with the classical proofs known as <em class="emphasis">ethos</em>, <em class="emphasis">logos</em>, and <em class="emphasis">pathos</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ethos</a><span class="glossdef">Credibility.</span></span>, or your credibility, will come through with your choice of sources and authority on the subject(s). Your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">logos</a><span class="glossdef">Logic and reason.</span></span>, or the logic of your thoughts represented across the document, will allow the reader to come to understand the relationships among who, what, where, when, and so forth. If your readers cannot follow your logic they will lose interest, fail to understand your message, and possibly not even read it at all. Finally, your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pathos</a><span class="glossdef">Passion and enthusiasm.</span></span>, or passion and enthusiasm, will be reflected in your design and word choices. If your document fails to convey enthusiasm for the subject, how can you expect the reader to be interested? Every document, indeed every communication, represents aspects of these classical elements.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">General Purpose and Thesis Statements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s01_p01">No matter what your business writing project involves, it needs to convey some central idea. To clarify the idea in your mind and make sure it comes through to your audience, write a thesis statement. A thesis statement, or central idea, should be short, specific, and to the point. Steven Beebe and Susan Beebe<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn06_002">Beebe, S. [Steven], &amp; Beebe, S. [Susan]. (1997). <em class="emphasis">Public speaking: An audience-centered approach</em> (3rd ed., pp. 121–122). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> recommend five guiding principles when considering your thesis statement. The thesis statement should</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>be a declarative statement;</li>
            <li>be a complete sentence;</li>
            <li>use specific language, not vague generalities;</li>
            <li>be a single idea;</li>
            <li>reflect consideration of the audience.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s01_p02">This statement is key to the success of your document. If your audience has to work to find out what exactly you are talking about, or what your stated purpose or goal is, they will be less likely to read, be influenced, or recall what you have written. By stating your point clearly in your introduction, and then referring back to it in the body of the document and at the end, you will help your readers to understand and remember your message.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizing Principles</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Once you know the basic elements of your message, you need to decide in what order to present them to your audience. A central organizing principle will help you determine a logical order for your information. One common organizing principle is chronology, or time: the writer tells what happened first, then what happened next, then what is happening now, and, finally, what is expected to happen in the future. Another common organizing principle is comparison: the writer describes one product, an argument on one side of an issue, or one possible course of action; and then compares it with another product, argument, or course of action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p02">As an example, let’s imagine that you are a business writer within the transportation industry and you have been assigned to write a series of informative pieces about an international initiative called the “TransAmerica Transportation System Study.” Just as the First Transcontinental Railroad once unified the United States from east to west, which was further reinforced by the Interstate Highway System, the proposed TransAmerica Transportation System will facilitate integrating the markets of Mexico, the United States, and Canada from north to south. Rail transportation has long been an integral part of the transportation and distribution system for goods across the Americas, and its role will be important in this new system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p03">In deciding how to organize your report, you have several challenges and many possibilities of different organizing principles to use. Part of your introduction will involve a historical perspective, and a discussion of the events that led from the First Transcontinental Railroad to the TransAmerica Transportation System proposal. Other aspects will include comparing the old railroad and highway systems to the new ones, and the transformative effect this will have on business and industry. You will need to acknowledge the complex relationships and challenges that collaboration has overcome, and highlight the common benefits. You will be called on to write informative documents as part of a public relations initiative, persuasive essays to underscore the benefits for those who prefer the status quo, and even write speeches for celebrations and awards.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p04"><a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch06_s01_s02_t01">Table 6.1 "Organizing Principles"</a> lists seventeen different organizing principles and how they might be applied to various pieces you would write about the TransAmerican Transportation System. The left column provides the name of the organizing principle. The center column explains the process of organizing a document according to each principle, and the third column provides an example.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Paragraphs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_p01">Paragraphs are how we package information in business communication, and the more efficient the package, the easier the meaning can be delivered.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_p02">You may wish to think of each paragraph as a small essay within a larger information platform, defined by a guiding thesis and an organizing principle. The standard five-paragraph essay format used on college term papers is mirrored in individual paragraphs. Often college essays have minimum or maximum word counts, but paragraphs hardly ever have established limits. Each paragraph focuses on one central idea. It can be as long or as short as it needs to be to get the message across, but remember your audience and avoid long, drawn-out paragraphs that may lose your reader’s attention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_p03">Just as a document generally has an introduction, body, and conclusion, so does a paragraph. Each paragraph has one idea, thought, or purpose that is stated in an introductory sentence. This is followed by one or more supporting sentences and concluded with a summary statement and transition or link to the next idea, or paragraph. Let’s address each in turn:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that states the main thesis, purpose, or subject of the paragraph.</span></span> states the main thesis, purpose, or topic of the paragraph; it defines the subject matter to be addressed in that paragraph.</li>
            <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Body sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentences that support the topic sentence and relate clearly to the subject matter of the paragraph and overall document.</span></span> support the topic sentence and relate clearly to the subject matter of the paragraph and overall document. They may use an organizing principle similar to that of the document itself (chronology, contrast, spatial) or introduce a related organizing principle (point by point, process or procedure).</li>
            <li>The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conclusion sentence</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that brings the paragraph to a close.</span></span> brings the paragraph to a close; it may do this in any of several ways. It may reinforce the paragraph’s main point, summarize the relationships among the body sentences, and/or serve as a transition to the next paragraph.</li>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Effective Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p01">We have talked about the organization of documents and paragraphs, but what about the organization of sentences? You have probably learned in English courses that each sentence needs to have a subject and a verb; most sentences also have an object. There are four basic types of sentences: declarative, imperative, interrogative, and exclamatory. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Declarative</strong> – You are invited to join us for lunch.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Imperative</strong> – Please join us for lunch.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Interrogative</strong> – Would you like to join us for lunch?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Exclamatory</strong> – I’m so glad you can join us!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Declarative sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that makes a statement.</span></span> make a statement, whereas <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interrogative sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that asks a question.</span></span> ask a question. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Imperative sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that conveys a command.</span></span> convey a command, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exclamatory sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that expresses a strong emotion.</span></span> express a strong emotion. Interrogative and exclamatory sentences are easy to identify by their final punctuation, a question mark and an exclamation point, respectively. In business writing, declarative and imperative sentences are more frequently used.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p03">There are also compound and complex sentences, which may use two or more of the four basic types in combination:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l02">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Simple sentence</em>. Sales have increased.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Compound sentence</em>. Sales have increased and profits continue to grow.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Complex sentence</em>. Sales have increased and we have the sales staff to thank for it.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Compound complex sentence</em>. Although the economy has been in recession, sales have increased, and we have sales staff to thank for it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p04">In our simple sentence, “sales” serves as the subject and “have increased” serves as the verb. The sentence can stand alone because it has the two basic parts that constitute a sentence. In our compound sentence we have two independent clauses that could stand alone; they are joined by the conjunction “and.” In our complex sentence, we have an independent clause, which can stand on its own, combined with a fragment (not a sentence) or dependent clause which, if it were not joined to the independent clause, would not make any sense. The fragment “and we have the sales staff to thank” on its own would have us asking “for what?” as the subject is absent. Complex compound sentences combine a mix of independent and dependent clauses, and at least one of the clauses must be dependent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p05">The ability to write complete, correct sentences is like any other skill—it comes with practice. The more writing you do, as you make an effort to use correct grammar, the easier it will become. Reading audiences, particularly in a business context, will not waste their time on poor writing and will move on. Your challenge as an effective business writer is to know what you are going to write and then to make it come across, via words, symbols, and images, in a clear and concise manner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p06">Sentences should avoid being vague and focus on specific content. Each sentence should convey a complete thought; a vague sentence fails to meet this criteria. The reader is left wondering what the sentence was supposed to convey.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l03">
            <li>Vague – We can facilitate solutions in pursuit of success by leveraging our core strengths.</li>
            <li>Specific – By using our knowledge, experience, and capabilities, we can achieve the production targets for the coming quarter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p07">Effective sentences also limit the range and scope of each complete thought, avoiding needless complexity. Sometimes writers mistakenly equate long, complex sentences with excellence and skill. Clear, concise, and often brief sentences serve to communicate ideas and concepts in effective and efficient ways that complex, hard-to-follow sentences do not.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l04">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Complex</em>. Air transportation features speed of delivery in ways few other forms of transportation can match, including tractor-trailer and rail, and is readily available to the individual consumer and the corporate client alike.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Clear</em>. Air transportation is accessible and faster than railroad or trucking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p08">Effective sentences are complete, containing a subject and a verb. Incomplete sentences—also known as sentence fragments—demonstrate a failure to pay attention to detail. They often invite misunderstanding, which is the opposite of our goal in business communication.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l05">
            <li>Fragments – Although air transportation is fast. Costs more than trucking.</li>
            <li>Complete – Although air transportation is fast, it costs more than trucking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p09">Effective business writing avoids bureaucratic language and phrase that are the hallmark of decoration. Decoration is a reflection of ritual, and ritual has its role. If you are the governor of a state, and want to make a resolution declaring today as HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, you are allowed to start the document with “Whereas” because of its ritual importance. Similarly, if you are writing a legal document, tradition calls for certain standard phrases such as “know all men by these presents.” However, in standard business writing, it is best to refrain from using bureaucratic phrases and ritualistic words that decorate and distract the reader from your clear, essential meaning. If the customer, client, or supplier does not understand the message the first time, each follow-up attempt to clarify the meaning through interaction is a cost. <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch06_s01_s05_t01">Table 6.4 "Bureaucratic Phrases and Standard Alternatives"</a> presents a few examples of common bureaucratic phrases and standard English alternatives.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p10">In oral communication, repetition can be an effective strategy to reinforce a message, but in written communication it adds needless length to a document and impairs clarity.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l06">
            <li>Redundant – In this day and age air transportation by air carrier is the clear winner over alternative modes of conveyance for speed and meeting tight deadlines.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p11">When a writer states that something is a “true fact,” a group achieved a “consensus of opinion,” or that the “final outcome” was declared, the word choices reflect an unnecessary redundancy. A fact, consensus, or outcome need not be qualified with words that state similar concepts. If it is fact, it is true. A consensus, by definition, is formed in a group from diverse opinions. An outcome is the final result, so adding the word “final” repeats the fact unnecessarily.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p12">In business writing we seek clear and concise writing that speaks for itself with little or no misinterpretation. The more complex a sentence becomes, the easier it is to lose track of its meaning. When we consider that it may read by someone for whom English is a second language, the complex sentence becomes even more problematic. If we consider its translation, we add another layer of complexity that can lead to miscommunication. Finally, effective sentences follow the KISS formula for success: Keep It Simple—Simplify!</p>
