    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p01">Even if you are writing on a subject you know well, you will usually get additional information from other sources. How you represent others’ ideas, concepts, and words is critical to your credibility and the effectiveness of your document. Let’s say you are reading a section of a document and find a point that relates well to your current writing assignment. How do you represent what you have read in your work? You have several choices.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p02">One choice is simply to reproduce the quote <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">verbatim</a><span class="glossdef">Word for word.</span></span>, or word for word, making sure that you have copied all words and punctuation accurately. In this case, you will put quotation marks around the quoted passage (or, if it is more than about fifty words long, inset it with wider margins than the body of your document) and give credit to the source. The format you use for your source citation will vary according to the discipline or industry of your audience; common formats include APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), and CMS (Chicago Manual of Style).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p03">Another common strategy in business writing is to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paraphrase</a><span class="glossdef">To rewrite information in your own words.</span></span>, or rewrite the information in your own words. You will relate the main point, but need to take care not to copy the original. You will give credit where credit is due, but your citation will be more informal, such as “A <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> article dated July 8, 2009, described some of the disagreements among G-8 nations about climate change.” Here are several steps that can help you paraphrase a passage while respecting its original author:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_l02">
        <li>Read the passage out loud, paying attention to the complete thought rather than the individual words.</li>
        <li>Explain the concept in your own words to a friend or colleague, out loud, face-to-face.</li>
        <li>Write the concept in your own words, and add one or more illustrative examples of the concept that are meaningful to you.</li>
        <li>Reread the original passage and see how your version compares with it in terms of grammar, word choice, example, and conveyance of meaning.</li>
        <li>If your writing parrots the original passage or merely substitutes synonyms for words in the original, return to step one and start over, remembering that your goal is to express the central concepts, not to “translate” one word into another.</li>
        <li>When you are satisfied that your expression of the concept can stand on its own merit, include it in your document and cite the original author as the source of the idea.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p04">Summarizing information is another common way of integrating information into your original work that requires care and attention to detail. To <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summarize</a><span class="glossdef">To reduce a concept, idea, or data set to its most basic point or element.</span></span> is to reduce a concept, idea, or data set to its most basic point or element. You may have a literature survey to summarize related information in the field under consideration, or a section on background to serve a similar purpose. Suppose you are reporting on a business situation and it occurs to you that one of Shakespeare’s plays has a plot that resembles your situation. You may wish to summarize the Shakespeare play in a few sentences before drawing parallels between it and your current situation. This may help readers to remember and understand your report. Regardless of how or where you incorporate a summary within your document, give attention to its original context and retain its essential meaning free of distortion in the new context of your writing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p05">Because summarizing is an act of reductionism, some of the original richness in detail that surrounds the original will be necessarily lost. Think of a photograph you have taken in the past that featured several people you know. Using a software program that allows you to modify and manipulate the image, draw a box around only one face. Delete the rest of the contents of the photo so only the information in the box remains. Part of the photo is intact, and one person has become the focal point for the image, but the context has been lost. In the same way, if you focus on one statistic, one quote, or one idea and fail to capture its background you will take the information out of context. Context is one of the eight components of communication, and without it, the process breaks down. While you cannot retain all the definition and detail of the original context in a brief summary, effort to represent the essential point within its context is essential or you risk distortion of the original meaning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p06">Unlike quoting or paraphrasing, summarizing is something you can—and will—also do to the material you have written. You may start your document with a summary of the background that gives the document purpose. Formal business reports often begin with an executive summary, and scientific articles usually begin with an abstract; both of these serve as a brief preview of the information in the full document. You may write a brief internal summary after each main discussion point in a lengthy document; this will serve to remind your reader of the discussion to date and to establish the context for the upcoming point. Finally, a summary is a very common, and often effective, way to conclude a document. Ending your writing with a summary helps your reader to remember your main points.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p07">Plagiarism is neither paraphrasing nor summarizing information from other works. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Plagiarism</a><span class="glossdef">Representing another’s work as your own.</span></span> is representing another’s work as your own. Professional standards, which are upheld in all fields from architecture to banking to zoology, all involve the elements of authenticity and credibility. Credit is given where credit is due, authorities in the field are appropriately cited or referenced, and original writing is expected to be exactly that. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Patch writing</a><span class="glossdef">Verbatim cut-and-paste insertion of fragments of other publications into one’s own writing without crediting the sources.</span></span>, or the verbatim cut-and-paste insertion of fragments, snippets, or small sections of other publications into your own writing without crediting the sources, is plagiarism. Wholesale copying of other works is also plagiarism. Both destroy your professional credibility, and fail to uphold common professional standards.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p08">Colleges and universities have policies against plagiarism, and within business and industry, the negative impact on credibility and careers often exceeds any academic punishment. There is no shame in quoting someone else’s work while giving credit, nor in paraphrasing a point correctly or summarizing the research results of a study you did not perform; but there are significant consequences to representing other’s ideas as your own.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p09">Aside from the fear of punishment, a skilled business writer should recognize that intellectual theft is wrong. You may be tempted to borrow a sentence; however, know your document will be represented in many ways across time, and more than one career has been destroyed by plagiarism discovered years after the fact. The accomplished business writer should take as a compliment the correct citation and reference of their work. The novice business writer should learn by example but refrain from cut and paste strategies to complete a document.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p10">In a world where most modern documents are accessible in some form online, the ability to cross-reference information with a couple of key strokes makes plagiarism a self-defeating solution when better alternatives exist. Quote and give credit, link to related documents with permission, paraphrase and summarize with citation, but do not plagiarize.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p11">There is nothing wrong with quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing with credit to your original source, but presenting someone else’s work as if it were your own is plagiarism.</p>
