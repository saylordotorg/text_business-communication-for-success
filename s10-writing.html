        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s00_p01">If all the world is a stage then you, as a business writer, must be the script writer, correct? Actually, those who employ you, specify your job duties, manage the business, and designate which problems you are to solve are more like the script writers, directors, and producers. So what role does that leave you as a business writer? Actor. You may not be seen “on stage” by the suppliers you write, the departments you inform with your reports, or the customers you serve, but your writing represents you and your organization. As an actor must learn his or her lines, you too must learn the role of a business writer within the context of your business or organization. It may well be that you are allowed a degree of improvisation and creativity when you interpret your role, or it could be the case that many of the written documents you will produce follow a standard template, much like a script, that designates your lines before the writing process begins. Knowing your place on stage and how it relates to your business is an important aspect of business writing best not ignored.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s00_p02">This chapter focuses on several strategies for success when it comes to the creative process of writing, and your awareness of these skills will prove invaluable as your responsibility increases and your ability to shape documents develops. Never lose sight of the fact that each document exists with a universe of relationships and interaction; it does not stand alone. Also remember that what you write today, particularly if you “publish” it on the Internet, will be there for years to come. Always consider how your words will represent you and your organization when you are not there to clarify, defend, or correct them. Your audience will have expectations of you, as will your employer, and as an effective business writer you know that one key to success is meeting these expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s00_p03">Creative writing for exposition, narration, and self-expression is an important part of writing, but in the business context you have a role, job duties, and responsibilities both internal and external to your organization. Your mastery of clear and concise writing will directly affect the interpretation, and misinterpretation, of your message. Your goal remains to reduce misunderstandings through the effective and efficient use of words in business documents, and the well-known mandate to “Omit needless words”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn06_001">Strunk, W., Jr., &amp; White, E.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_p01">The purpose of business writing is to communicate facts and ideas. In order to accomplish that purpose, each document has key components that need to be present in order for your reading audience to understand the message. These elements may seem simple to the point that you may question how any writer could neglect them. But if you take note of how often miscommunication and misunderstanding happen, particularly in written communications, you will realize that it happens all the time. Omission or neglect may be intentional, but it is often unintentional; the writer assumes (wrongly) that the reader will easily understand a concept, idea, or the meaning of the message. From background to language, culture to education, there are many variables that come into play and make effective communication a challenge. The degree to which you address these basic elements will increase the effectiveness of your documents. Each document must address the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_l02">
        <li>Who</li>
        <li>What</li>
        <li>When</li>
        <li>Where</li>
        <li>How</li>
        <li>(and sometimes) Why</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_p02">If you have these elements in mind as you prepare your document, it will be easier to decide what to write and in what order. They will also be useful when you are reviewing your document before delivering it. If your draft omits any one of these elements or addresses it in an unclear fashion, you will know what you need to do to fix it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_p03">Another way to approach organizing your document is with the classical proofs known as <em class="emphasis">ethos</em>, <em class="emphasis">logos</em>, and <em class="emphasis">pathos</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ethos</a><span class="glossdef">Credibility.</span></span>, or your credibility, will come through with your choice of sources and authority on the subject(s). Your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">logos</a><span class="glossdef">Logic and reason.</span></span>, or the logic of your thoughts represented across the document, will allow the reader to come to understand the relationships among who, what, where, when, and so forth. If your readers cannot follow your logic they will lose interest, fail to understand your message, and possibly not even read it at all. Finally, your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pathos</a><span class="glossdef">Passion and enthusiasm.</span></span>, or passion and enthusiasm, will be reflected in your design and word choices. If your document fails to convey enthusiasm for the subject, how can you expect the reader to be interested? Every document, indeed every communication, represents aspects of these classical elements.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">General Purpose and Thesis Statements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s01_p01">No matter what your business writing project involves, it needs to convey some central idea. To clarify the idea in your mind and make sure it comes through to your audience, write a thesis statement. A thesis statement, or central idea, should be short, specific, and to the point. Steven Beebe and Susan Beebe<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn06_002">Beebe, S. [Steven], &amp; Beebe, S. [Susan]. (1997). <em class="emphasis">Public speaking: An audience-centered approach</em> (3rd ed., pp. 121–122). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> recommend five guiding principles when considering your thesis statement. The thesis statement should</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>be a declarative statement;</li>
            <li>be a complete sentence;</li>
            <li>use specific language, not vague generalities;</li>
            <li>be a single idea;</li>
            <li>reflect consideration of the audience.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s01_p02">This statement is key to the success of your document. If your audience has to work to find out what exactly you are talking about, or what your stated purpose or goal is, they will be less likely to read, be influenced, or recall what you have written. By stating your point clearly in your introduction, and then referring back to it in the body of the document and at the end, you will help your readers to understand and remember your message.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizing Principles</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Once you know the basic elements of your message, you need to decide in what order to present them to your audience. A central organizing principle will help you determine a logical order for your information. One common organizing principle is chronology, or time: the writer tells what happened first, then what happened next, then what is happening now, and, finally, what is expected to happen in the future. Another common organizing principle is comparison: the writer describes one product, an argument on one side of an issue, or one possible course of action; and then compares it with another product, argument, or course of action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p02">As an example, let’s imagine that you are a business writer within the transportation industry and you have been assigned to write a series of informative pieces about an international initiative called the “TransAmerica Transportation System Study.” Just as the First Transcontinental Railroad once unified the United States from east to west, which was further reinforced by the Interstate Highway System, the proposed TransAmerica Transportation System will facilitate integrating the markets of Mexico, the United States, and Canada from north to south. Rail transportation has long been an integral part of the transportation and distribution system for goods across the Americas, and its role will be important in this new system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p03">In deciding how to organize your report, you have several challenges and many possibilities of different organizing principles to use. Part of your introduction will involve a historical perspective, and a discussion of the events that led from the First Transcontinental Railroad to the TransAmerica Transportation System proposal. Other aspects will include comparing the old railroad and highway systems to the new ones, and the transformative effect this will have on business and industry. You will need to acknowledge the complex relationships and challenges that collaboration has overcome, and highlight the common benefits. You will be called on to write informative documents as part of a public relations initiative, persuasive essays to underscore the benefits for those who prefer the status quo, and even write speeches for celebrations and awards.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s02_p04"><a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch06_s01_s02_t01">Table 6.1 "Organizing Principles"</a> lists seventeen different organizing principles and how they might be applied to various pieces you would write about the TransAmerican Transportation System. The left column provides the name of the organizing principle. The center column explains the process of organizing a document according to each principle, and the third column provides an example.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Paragraphs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_p01">Paragraphs are how we package information in business communication, and the more efficient the package, the easier the meaning can be delivered.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_p02">You may wish to think of each paragraph as a small essay within a larger information platform, defined by a guiding thesis and an organizing principle. The standard five-paragraph essay format used on college term papers is mirrored in individual paragraphs. Often college essays have minimum or maximum word counts, but paragraphs hardly ever have established limits. Each paragraph focuses on one central idea. It can be as long or as short as it needs to be to get the message across, but remember your audience and avoid long, drawn-out paragraphs that may lose your reader’s attention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_p03">Just as a document generally has an introduction, body, and conclusion, so does a paragraph. Each paragraph has one idea, thought, or purpose that is stated in an introductory sentence. This is followed by one or more supporting sentences and concluded with a summary statement and transition or link to the next idea, or paragraph. Let’s address each in turn:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that states the main thesis, purpose, or subject of the paragraph.</span></span> states the main thesis, purpose, or topic of the paragraph; it defines the subject matter to be addressed in that paragraph.</li>

<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Body sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentences that support the topic sentence and relate clearly to the subject matter of the paragraph and overall document.</span></span> support the topic sentence and relate clearly to the subject matter of the paragraph and overall document. They may use an organizing principle similar to that of the document itself (chronology, contrast, spatial) or introduce a related organizing principle (point by point, process or procedure).</li>
            <li>The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conclusion sentence</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that brings the paragraph to a close.</span></span> brings the paragraph to a close; it may do this in any of several ways.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Effective Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p01">We have talked about the organization of documents and paragraphs, but what about the organization of sentences? You have probably learned in English courses that each sentence needs to have a subject and a verb; most sentences also have an object. There are four basic types of sentences: declarative, imperative, interrogative, and exclamatory. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Declarative</strong> – You are invited to join us for lunch.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Imperative</strong> – Please join us for lunch.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Interrogative</strong> – Would you like to join us for lunch?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Exclamatory</strong> – I’m so glad you can join us!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Declarative sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that makes a statement.</span></span> make a statement, whereas <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interrogative sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that asks a question.</span></span> ask a question. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Imperative sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that conveys a command.</span></span> convey a command, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exclamatory sentences</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence that expresses a strong emotion.</span></span> express a strong emotion. Interrogative and exclamatory sentences are easy to identify by their final punctuation, a question mark and an exclamation point, respectively. In business writing, declarative and imperative sentences are more frequently used.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p03">There are also compound and complex sentences, which may use two or more of the four basic types in combination:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l02">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Simple sentence</em>. Sales have increased.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Compound sentence</em>. Sales have increased and profits continue to grow.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Complex sentence</em>. Sales have increased and we have the sales staff to thank for it.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Compound complex sentence</em>. Although the economy has been in recession, sales have increased, and we have sales staff to thank for it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p04">In our simple sentence, “sales” serves as the subject and “have increased” serves as the verb. The sentence can stand alone because it has the two basic parts that constitute a sentence. In our compound sentence we have two independent clauses that could stand alone; they are joined by the conjunction “and.” In our complex sentence, we have an independent clause, which can stand on its own, combined with a fragment (not a sentence) or dependent clause which, if it were not joined to the independent clause, would not make any sense. The fragment “and we have the sales staff to thank” on its own would have us asking “for what?” as the subject is absent. Complex compound sentences combine a mix of independent and dependent clauses, and at least one of the clauses must be dependent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p05">The ability to write complete, correct sentences is like any other skill—it comes with practice. The more writing you do, as you make an effort to use correct grammar, the easier it will become. Reading audiences, particularly in a business context, will not waste their time on poor writing and will move on. Your challenge as an effective business writer is to know what you are going to write and then to make it come across, via words, symbols, and images, in a clear and concise manner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p06">Sentences should avoid being vague and focus on specific content. Each sentence should convey a complete thought; a vague sentence fails to meet this criteria. The reader is left wondering what the sentence was supposed to convey.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l03">
            <li>Vague – We can facilitate solutions in pursuit of success by leveraging our core strengths.</li>
            <li>Specific – By using our knowledge, experience, and capabilities, we can achieve the production targets for the coming quarter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p07">Effective sentences also limit the range and scope of each complete thought, avoiding needless complexity. Sometimes writers mistakenly equate long, complex sentences with excellence and skill. Clear, concise, and often brief sentences serve to communicate ideas and concepts in effective and efficient ways that complex, hard-to-follow sentences do not.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l04">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Complex</em>. Air transportation features speed of delivery in ways few other forms of transportation can match, including tractor-trailer and rail, and is readily available to the individual consumer and the corporate client alike.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Clear</em>. Air transportation is accessible and faster than railroad or trucking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p08">Effective sentences are complete, containing a subject and a verb. Incomplete sentences—also known as sentence fragments—demonstrate a failure to pay attention to detail. They often invite misunderstanding, which is the opposite of our goal in business communication.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l05">
            <li>Fragments – Although air transportation is fast. Costs more than trucking.</li>
            <li>Complete – Although air transportation is fast, it costs more than trucking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p09">Effective business writing avoids bureaucratic language and phrase that are the hallmark of decoration. Decoration is a reflection of ritual, and ritual has its role. If you are the governor of a state, and want to make a resolution declaring today as HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, you are allowed to start the document with “Whereas” because of its ritual importance. Similarly, if you are writing a legal document, tradition calls for certain standard phrases such as “know all men by these presents.” However, in standard business writing, it is best to refrain from using bureaucratic phrases and ritualistic words that decorate and distract the reader from your clear, essential meaning. If the customer, client, or supplier does not understand the message the first time, each follow-up attempt to clarify the meaning through interaction is a cost. <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch06_s01_s05_t01">Table 6.4 "Bureaucratic Phrases and Standard Alternatives"</a> presents a few examples of common bureaucratic phrases and standard English alternatives.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p10">In oral communication, repetition can be an effective strategy to reinforce a message, but in written communication it adds needless length to a document and impairs clarity.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_l06">

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p11">When a writer states that something is a “true fact,” a group achieved a “consensus of opinion,” or that the “final outcome” was declared, the word choices reflect an unnecessary redundancy. A fact, consensus, or outcome need not be qualified with words that state similar concepts. If it is fact, it is true. A consensus, by definition, is formed in a group from diverse opinions. An outcome is the final result, so adding the word “final” repeats the fact unnecessarily.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s01_s05_p12">In business writing we seek clear and concise writing that speaks for itself with little or no misinterpretation. The more complex a sentence becomes, the easier it is to lose track of its meaning. When we consider that it may read by someone for whom English is a second language, the complex sentence becomes even more problematic. If we consider its translation, we add another layer of complexity that can lead to miscommunication. Finally, effective sentences follow the KISS formula for success: Keep It Simple—Simplify!</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_p01">You are invited to a business dinner at an expensive restaurant that has been the top-rated dining establishment in your town for decades. You are aware of the restaurant’s dress code, which forbids casual attire such as jeans, T-shirts, and sneakers. What will you wear? If you want to fit in with the other guests and make a favorable impression on your hosts, you will choose a good quality suit or dress (and appropriately dressy shoes and accessories). You will avoid calling undue attention to yourself with clothing that is overly formal—an evening gown or a tuxedo, for example—or that would distract from the business purpose of the occasion by being overly revealing or provocative. You may feel that your freedom to express yourself by dressing as you please is being restricted, or you may appreciate the opportunity to look your best. Either way, adhering to these style conventions will serve you well in a business context.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_p02">The same is true in business writing. Unlike some other kinds of writing such as poetry or fiction, business writing is not an opportunity for self-expression. Instead it calls for a fairly conservative and unadorned style. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Writing style</a><span class="glossdef">Also known as voice or tone; the manner in which a writer addresses the reader.</span></span>, also known as voice or tone, is the manner in which a writer addresses the reader.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Formal versus Informal</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p01">There was a time when many business documents were written in third person to give them the impression of objectivity. This formal style was often passive and wordy. Today it has given way to active, clear, concise writing, sometimes known as “Plain English.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn06_006">Bailey, E. P. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Plain English at work: A guide to business writing and speaking</em>. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</span> As business and industry increasingly trade across borders and languages, writing techniques that obscure meaning or impede understanding can cause serious problems. Efficient writing styles have become the norm. Still, you will experience in your own writing efforts this “old school versus new school” writing debate over abbreviations, contractions, and the use of informal language in what was once considered a formal business context. Consider the following comparison of informal versus formal and bureaucratic styles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p02">Bureaucratic: Attached is the latest delivery data represented in topographical forms pursuant to the directive ABC123 of the air transportation guide supplied by the Federal Aviation Administration in September of 2008.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Formal – Please note the attached delivery data for July 2009.</li>
            <li>Informal – Here’s the delivery data for last month.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p03">While it is generally agreed that bureaucratic forms can obscure meaning, there is a debate on the use of formal versus informal styles in business communication. Formal styles often require more detail, adhere to rules of etiquette, and avoid shortcuts like contractions and folksy expressions. Informal styles reflect everyday speech patterns and may include contractions and colloquial expressions. Many managers prefer not to see contractions in a formal business context. Others will point out that a comma preceding the last item in a series (known as the “serial comma”) is the standard, not the exception. Some will make a general recommendation that you should always “keep it professional.” Here lies the heart of the debate: what <em class="emphasis">is</em> professional writing in a business context? If you answered “it depends,” you are correct.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p04">Keep in mind that audiences have expectations and your job is to meet them. Some business audiences prefer a fairly formal tone. If you include contractions or use a style that is too casual, you may lose their interest and attention; you may also give them a negative impression of your level of expertise. If, however, you are writing for an audience that expects informal language, you may lose their interest and attention by writing too formally; your writing may also come across as arrogant or pompous. It is not that one style is better than the other, but simply that styles of writing vary across a range of options. Business writing may need to meet legal standards and include references, as we see in the bureaucratic example above, but that is generally not the norm for communications within an organization. The skilled business writer will know his or her audience and will adapt the message to best facilitate communication. Choosing the right style can make a significant impact on how your writing is received.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p05">You may hear reference to a conversational tone in writing as one option in business communication. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversational tone</a><span class="glossdef">Writing style that resembles oral communication.</span></span>, as the name implies, resembles oral communication in style, tone, and word choice. It can be appropriate for some audiences, and may serve you well in specific contexts, but it can easily come across as less than professional.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p06">If you use expressions that imply a relationship or a special awareness of information such as “you know,” or “as we discussed,” without explaining the necessary background, your writing may be seen as overly familiar, intimate, or even secretive. Trust is the foundation for all communication interactions and a careless word or phrase can impair trust.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p07">If you want to use humor, think carefully about how your audience will interpret it. Humor is a fragile form of communication that requires an awareness of irony, of juxtaposition, or a shared sense of attitudes, beliefs, and values. Different people find humor in different situations, and what is funny to one person may be dull, or even hurtful, to someone else.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p08">Although there are business situations such as an interview or a performance self-evaluation where you need to state your accomplishments, in general business writing it is best to avoid self-referential comments that allude to your previous successes. These can come across as selfish or arrogant. Instead, be generous in giving credit where credit is due. Take every opportunity to thank your colleagues for their efforts and to acknowledge those who contributed good ideas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p09">Jargon is a vocabulary that has been developed by people in a particular group, discipline, or industry, and it can be a useful shorthand as long as the audience knows its meaning. For example, when writing for bank customers, you could refer to “ATM transactions” and feel confident that your readers would know what you meant. It would be unnecessary and inappropriate to write “Automated Teller Machine transactions.” Similarly, if you were working in a hospital, you would probably use many medical terms in your interactions with other medical professionals. However, if you were a hospital employee writing to a patient, using medical jargon would be inappropriate, as it would not contribute to the patient’s understanding.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s01_p10">Finally, in a business context, remember that conversational style is not an excuse to use poor grammar, disrespectful or offensive slang, or profanity. Communication serves as the bridge between minds and your written words will represent you in your absence. One strategy when trying to use a conversation tone is to ask yourself, “Would I say it in this way to their face?” A follow-up question to consider is, “Would I say it in this way in front of everyone?” Your professional use of language is one the hallmark skills in business, and the degree to which you master its use will reflect itself in your success. Take care, take time, and make sure what you write communicates a professional tone that positively represents you and your organization.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Introductions: Direct and Indirect</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s02_p01">Sometimes the first sentence is the hardest to write. When you know the two main opening strategies it may not make it any easier, but it will give a plan and form a framework. Business documents often incorporate one of two opening strategies regardless of their organizational pattern. The direct pattern states the main purpose directly, at the beginning, and leaves little room for misinterpretation. The indirect pattern, where you introduce your main idea after the opening paragraph, can be useful if you need a strong opening to get the attention of what you perceive may be an uninterested audience. Normally, if you expect a positive response from the reader you will choose a direct opening, being clear from the first sentence about your purpose and goal. If you do not expect a positive reception, or have to deliver bad news, you may want to be less direct. Each style has its purpose and use; the skilled business writer will learn to be direct and be able to present bad news with a positive opening paragraph.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Adding Emphasis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_p01">There are times when you will want to add emphasis to a word, phrase, or statistic so that it stands out from the surrounding text. The use of visual aids in your writing can be an excellent option, and can reinforce the written discussion. For example, if you write that sales are up 4 percent over this time last year, the number alone may not get the attention it deserves. If, however, near the text section you feature a bar graph demonstrating the sales growth figures, the representation of the information in textual and graphical way may reinforce its importance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_p02">As you look across the top of your word processing program you may notice <strong class="emphasis bold">bold</strong>, <em class="emphasis">italics</em>, underline, highlights, your choice of colors, and a host of interesting fonts. Although it can be entertaining to experiment with these visual effects, do not use them just for the sake of decoration. Consistency and branding are important features of your firm’s public image, so you will want the visual aspects of your writing to support that image. Still, when you need to highlight an important fact or emphasize a key question in a report, your readers will appreciate your use of visual effects to draw their attention. Consider the following examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>Bullets can be effective when used with discretion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_p03">Take care when using the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_l02" numeration="lowerroman">
            <li>Numbers</li>
            <li>With subheadings</li>
            <li>In serial lists</li>
            <li>As they can get</li>
            <li>A bit overwhelming to the point where</li>
            <li>The reader loses his or her interest</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_p04">Emphasis can be influenced by your choice of font. Serif fonts, such as Times New Roman and Garamond, have decorative ends that make the font easy to read. Sans serif fonts, like Arial, lack these visual cues and often serve better as headers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_p05">You can also vary the emphasis according to where you place information within a sentence:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_l03">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Maximum emphasis</em>. Sales have increased across the United States because of our latest promotion efforts in our largest and most successful market.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Medium emphasis</em>. Because of our latest promotion efforts in our largest and most successful market, sales have increased across the United States.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Minimum emphasis</em>. The United States, which has experienced a sales increase, is our largest and most successful market.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s03_p06">The information at end of the sentence is what people often recall, and is therefore normally considered the location of maximum emphasis. The second best position for recall is the beginning of the sentence, while the middle of the sentence is the area with the least recall. If you want to highlight a point, place it at the beginning or end of the sentence, and if you want to deemphasize a point, the middle is your best option.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn06_007">McLean, S.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Active versus Passive Voice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s04_p01">You want your writing to be engaging. Which sentence would you rather read?</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>A – All sales orders are processed daily by Mackenzie.</li>
            <li>B – Mackenzie processes all sales orders daily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s04_p02">Most readers prefer sentence B, but why? You’ll recall that all sentences have a subject and a verb, but you may not have paid much attention to their functions. Let’s look at how the subject and verb function in these two sentences. In sentence A, the subject is “Mackenzie,” and the subject is the doer of the action expressed by the verb (processes). In sentence A, the subject is “sales orders,” and the subject is the receiver of the action expressed by the verb (are processed). Sentence B is written in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active voice</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence structure in which the subject carries out the action.</span></span>—a sentence structure in which the subject carries out the action. Sentence A is written in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">passive voice</a><span class="glossdef">Sentence structure in which the subject receives the action.</span></span>—a sentence structure in which the subject receives the action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s04_p03">Active sentences tend to be shorter, more precise, and easier to understand. This is especially true because passive sentences can be written in ways that do not tell the reader who the doer of the action is. For example, “All sales orders are processed daily” is a complete and correct sentence in passive voice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s04_p04">Active voice is the clear choice for a variety of contexts, but not all. When you want to deemphasize the doer of the action, you may write, “Ten late arrivals were recorded this month” and not even mention who was late. The passive form doesn’t place blame or credit, so it can be more diplomatic in some contexts. Passive voice allows the writer to avoid personal references or personal pronouns (he, she, they) to create a more objective tone. There are also situations where the doer of the action is unknown, as in “graffiti was painted on the side of our building last night.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s02_s04_p05">Overall, business communication resources tend to recommend active voice as the preferred style. Still, the styles themselves are not the problem or challenge, but it is how we use them that matters. A skilled business writer will see both styles as options within a range of choices and learn to distinguish when each style is most appropriate to facilitate communication.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_p01">According to the famous satirist Jonathan Swift, “Argument is the worst sort of conversation.” You may be inclined to agree. When people argue, they are engaged in conflict and it’s usually not pretty. It sometimes appears that way because people resort to fallacious arguments or false statements, or they simply do not treat each other with respect. They get defensive, try to prove their own points, and fail to listen to each other.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_p02">But this should not be what happens in written argument. Instead, when you make an argument in your writing, you will want to present your position with logical points, supporting each point with appropriate sources. You will want to give your audience every reason to perceive you as ethical and trustworthy. Your audience will expect you to treat them with respect, and to present your argument in a way that does not make them defensive. Contribute to your credibility by building sound arguments and using strategic arguments with skill and planning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_p03">In this section we will briefly discuss the classic form of an argument, a more modern interpretation, and finally seven basic arguments you may choose to use. Imagine that these are tools in your toolbox and that you want to know how each is effectively used. Know that the people who try to persuade you—from telemarketers to politicians—usually have these tools at hand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_p04">Let’s start with a classical rhetorical strategy. It asks the rhetorician, speaker, or author to frame arguments in the following steps:</p>

The pattern is useful to guide you in preparing your document and can serve as a valuable checklist to insure you are prepared. While this formal pattern has distinct advantages, you may not see it used exactly as indicated here on a daily basis. What may be more familiar to you is Stephen Toulmin’s rhetorical strategy, which focuses on three main elements (see <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch06_s03_t02">Table 6.8 "Toulmin’s Three-Part Rhetorical Strategy"</a>).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn06_008">Toulmin, S.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_p06">Toulmin’s rhetorical strategy is useful in that it makes the claim explicit, clearly illustrates the relationship between the claim and the data, and allows the reader to follow the writer’s reasoning. You may have a good idea or point, but your audience will want to know how you arrived at that claim or viewpoint. The warrant addresses the inherent and often unsaid question, “Why is this data so important to your topic?” In so doing, it helps you to illustrate relationships between information for your audience.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Evidence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s02_p01">Now that we’ve clearly outlined several argument strategies, how do you support your position with evidence or warrants? If your premise or the background from which you start is valid, and your claim is clear and clearly related, the audience will naturally turn their attention to “prove it.” This is where the relevance of evidence becomes particularly important. Here are three guidelines to consider in order to insure your evidence passes the “so what?” test of relevance in relation to your claim. Make sure your evidence has the following traits:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Supportive</em>. Examples are clearly representative, statistics are accurate, testimony is authoritative, and information is reliable.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Relevant</em>. Examples clearly relate to the claim or topic, and you are not comparing “apples to oranges.”</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Effective</em>. Examples are clearly the best available to support the claim, quality is preferred to quantity, there are only a few well-chosen statistics, facts, or data.</li>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Appealing to Emotions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03_p01">While we’ve highlighted several points to consider when selecting information to support your claim, know that Aristotle strongly preferred an argument based in logic over emotion. Can the same be said for your audience, and to what degree is emotion and your appeal to it in your audience a part of modern life?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Emotions</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological and physical reaction, such as fear or anger, to stimuli that we experience as a feeling.</span></span> are a psychological and physical reaction, such as fear or anger, to stimuli that we experience as a feeling. Our feelings or emotions directly impact our own point of view and readiness to communicate, but also influence how, why, and when we say things. Emotions influence not only how you say or what you say, but also how you hear or what you hear. At times, emotions can be challenging to control. Emotions will move your audience, and possibly even move you, to change or act in certain ways.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03_p03">Aristotle thought the best and most preferable way to persuade an audience was through the use of logic, free of emotion. He also recognized that people are often motivated, even manipulated, by the exploitation of their emotions. In a business context, we still engage in this debate, demanding to know the facts separate from personal opinion or agenda, but see the use of emotional appeal to sell products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03_p04">Marketing experts are famous for creating a need or associating an emotion with a brand or label in order to sell it. You will speak the language of your audience in your document, and may choose to appeal to emotion, but you need to consider how the strategy works, as it may be considered a tool that has two edges.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03_p05">If we think of the appeal to emotion as a knife, we can see it has two edges. One edge can cut your audience, and the other can cut you. If you advance an appeal to emotion in your document on spaying and neutering pets, and discuss the millions of unwanted pets that are killed each year, you may elicit an emotional response. If you use this approach repeatedly, your audience may grow weary of this approach, and it will lose its effectiveness. If you change your topic to the use of animals in research, the same strategy may apply, but repeated attempts to elicit an emotional response may backfire (i.e., in essence “cutting” you) and produce a negative response called “emotional resistance.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Emotional resistance</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when the audience gets tired, often to the point of rejection, of hearing messages that attempt to elicit an emotional response.</span></span> involves getting tired, often to the point of rejection, of hearing messages that attempt to elicit an emotional response. Emotional appeals can wear out the audience’s capacity to receive the message. As Aristotle outlined, ethos (credibility), logos (logic), and pathos (passion, enthusiasm, and emotional response) constitute the building blocks of any document. It’s up to you to create a balanced document, where you may appeal to emotion, but choose to use it judiciously.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s03_p07">On a related point, the use of an emotional appeal may also impair your ability to write persuasively or effectively. For example, if you choose to present an article about suicide to persuade people against committing it and you start showing a photo of your brother or sister that you lost to suicide, your emotional response may cloud your judgment and get in the way of your thinking. Never use a personal story, or even a story of someone you do not know, if the inclusion of that story causes you to lose control. While it’s important to discuss relevant topics, you need to assess your relationship to the message. Your documents should not be an exercise in therapy. Otherwise, you will sacrifice ethos and credibility, even your effectiveness, if you “lose it” because you are really not ready to discuss the issue.</p>

Fallacies or rhetorical tricks deceive your audience with their style, drama, or pattern, but add little to your document in terms of substance. They are best avoided because they can actually detract from your effectiveness.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s03_s05_p04">In your message to persuade, consider honesty and integrity as you assemble your arguments. Your audience will appreciate your thoughtful consideration of more than one view and your understanding of the complexity of the issue, thus building your ethos, or credibility, as you present your document. Be careful not to stretch the facts, or assemble them only to prove your point; instead, prove the argument on its own merits. Deception, coercion, intentional bias, manipulation and bribery should have no place in your message to persuade.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">6.4</span> Paraphrase and Summary versus Plagiarism</h2>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>

            <li>Understand the difference between paraphrasing or summarizing and plagiarism.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate how to give proper credit to sources that are quoted verbatim, and sources whose ideas are paraphrased or summarized.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p01">Even if you are writing on a subject you know well, you will usually get additional information from other sources. How you represent others’ ideas, concepts, and words is critical to your credibility and the effectiveness of your document. Let’s say you are reading a section of a document and find a point that relates well to your current writing assignment. How do you represent what you have read in your work? You have several choices.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p02">One choice is simply to reproduce the quote <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">verbatim</a><span class="glossdef">Word for word.</span></span>, or word for word, making sure that you have copied all words and punctuation accurately. In this case, you will put quotation marks around the quoted passage (or, if it is more than about fifty words long, inset it with wider margins than the body of your document) and give credit to the source. The format you use for your source citation will vary according to the discipline or industry of your audience; common formats include APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), and CMS (Chicago Manual of Style).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p03">Another common strategy in business writing is to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paraphrase</a><span class="glossdef">To rewrite information in your own words.</span></span>, or rewrite the information in your own words. You will relate the main point, but need to take care not to copy the original. You will give credit where credit is due, but your citation will be more informal, such as “A <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> article dated July 8, 2009, described some of the disagreements among G-8 nations about climate change.” Here are several steps that can help you paraphrase a passage while respecting its original author:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_l02">
        <li>Read the passage out loud, paying attention to the complete thought rather than the individual words.</li>
        <li>Explain the concept in your own words to a friend or colleague, out loud, face-to-face.</li>
        <li>Write the concept in your own words, and add one or more illustrative examples of the concept that are meaningful to you.</li>
        <li>Reread the original passage and see how your version compares with it in terms of grammar, word choice, example, and conveyance of meaning.</li>
        <li>If your writing parrots the original passage or merely substitutes synonyms for words in the original, return to step one and start over, remembering that your goal is to express the central concepts, not to “translate” one word into another.</li>
        <li>When you are satisfied that your expression of the concept can stand on its own merit, include it in your document and cite the original author as the source of the idea.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p04">Summarizing information is another common way of integrating information into your original work that requires care and attention to detail. To <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summarize</a><span class="glossdef">To reduce a concept, idea, or data set to its most basic point or element.</span></span> is to reduce a concept, idea, or data set to its most basic point or element. You may have a literature survey to summarize related information in the field under consideration, or a section on background to serve a similar purpose. Suppose you are reporting on a business situation and it occurs to you that one of Shakespeare’s plays has a plot that resembles your situation. You may wish to summarize the Shakespeare play in a few sentences before drawing parallels between it and your current situation. This may help readers to remember and understand your report. Regardless of how or where you incorporate a summary within your document, give attention to its original context and retain its essential meaning free of distortion in the new context of your writing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p05">Because summarizing is an act of reductionism, some of the original richness in detail that surrounds the original will be necessarily lost. Think of a photograph you have taken in the past that featured several people you know. Using a software program that allows you to modify and manipulate the image, draw a box around only one face. Delete the rest of the contents of the photo so only the information in the box remains. Part of the photo is intact, and one person has become the focal point for the image, but the context has been lost. In the same way, if you focus on one statistic, one quote, or one idea and fail to capture its background you will take the information out of context. Context is one of the eight components of communication, and without it, the process breaks down. While you cannot retain all the definition and detail of the original context in a brief summary, effort to represent the essential point within its context is essential or you risk distortion of the original meaning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p06">Unlike quoting or paraphrasing, summarizing is something you can—and will—also do to the material you have written. You may start your document with a summary of the background that gives the document purpose. Formal business reports often begin with an executive summary, and scientific articles usually begin with an abstract; both of these serve as a brief preview of the information in the full document. You may write a brief internal summary after each main discussion point in a lengthy document; this will serve to remind your reader of the discussion to date and to establish the context for the upcoming point. Finally, a summary is a very common, and often effective, way to conclude a document. Ending your writing with a summary helps your reader to remember your main points.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p07">Plagiarism is neither paraphrasing nor summarizing information from other works. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Plagiarism</a><span class="glossdef">Representing another’s work as your own.</span></span> is representing another’s work as your own. Professional standards, which are upheld in all fields from architecture to banking to zoology, all involve the elements of authenticity and credibility. Credit is given where credit is due, authorities in the field are appropriately cited or referenced, and original writing is expected to be exactly that. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Patch writing</a><span class="glossdef">Verbatim cut-and-paste insertion of fragments of other publications into one’s own writing without crediting the sources.</span></span>, or the verbatim cut-and-paste insertion of fragments, snippets, or small sections of other publications into your own writing without crediting the sources, is plagiarism. Wholesale copying of other works is also plagiarism. Both destroy your professional credibility, and fail to uphold common professional standards.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p08">Colleges and universities have policies against plagiarism, and within business and industry, the negative impact on credibility and careers often exceeds any academic punishment. There is no shame in quoting someone else’s work while giving credit, nor in paraphrasing a point correctly or summarizing the research results of a study you did not perform; but there are significant consequences to representing other’s ideas as your own.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p09">Aside from the fear of punishment, a skilled business writer should recognize that intellectual theft is wrong. You may be tempted to borrow a sentence; however, know your document will be represented in many ways across time, and more than one career has been destroyed by plagiarism discovered years after the fact. The accomplished business writer should take as a compliment the correct citation and reference of their work. The novice business writer should learn by example but refrain from cut and paste strategies to complete a document.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch06_s04_p10">In a world where most modern documents are accessible in some form online, the ability to cross-reference information with a couple of key strokes makes plagiarism a self-defeating solution when better alternatives exist. Quote and give credit, link to related documents with permission, paraphrase and summarize with citation, but do not plagiarize.</p>
