    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_p01">When revising your document, it can be helpful to focus on specific points. When you consider each point in turn, you will be able to break down the revision process into manageable steps. When you have examined each point, you can be confident that you have avoided many possible areas for errors. Specific revision requires attention to the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_l02">
        <li>Format</li>
        <li>Facts</li>
        <li>Names</li>
        <li>Spelling</li>
        <li>Punctuation</li>
        <li>Grammar</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_p02">Let’s examine these characteristics one by one.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Format</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s01_p01">Format is an important part of the revision process. Format involves the design expectations of author and audience. If a letter format normally designates a date at the top, or the sender’s address on the left side of the page before the salutation, the information should be in the correct location. Formatting that is messy or fails to conform to the company style will reflect poorly on you before the reader even starts to read it. By presenting a document that is properly formatted according to the expectations of your organization and your readers, you will start off making a good impression.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Facts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s02_p01">Another key part of the revision process is checking your facts. Did you know that news organizations and magazines employ professional fact-checkers? These workers are responsible for examining every article before it gets published and consulting original sources to make sure the information in the article is accurate. This can involve making phone calls to the people who were interviewed for the article—for example, “Mr. Diaz, our report states that you are thirty-nine years old. Our article will be published on the fifteenth. Will that be your correct age on that date?” Fact checking also involves looking facts up in encyclopedias, directories, atlases, and other standard reference works; and, increasingly, in online sources.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s02_p02">While you can’t be expected to have the skills of a professional fact-checker, you do need to reread your writing with a critical eye to the information in it. Inaccurate content can expose you and your organization to liability, and will create far more work than a simple revision of a document. So, when you revise a document, ask yourself the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Does my writing contain any statistics or references that need to be verified?</li>
            <li>Where can I get reliable information to verify it?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s02_p03">It is often useful to do <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">independent verification</a><span class="glossdef">Looking up facts in a different source from the one where you got it.</span></span>—that is, look up the fact in a different source from the one where you first got it. For example, perhaps a colleague gave you a list of closing averages for the Dow Jones Industrial on certain dates. You still have the list, so you can make sure your document agrees with the numbers your colleague provided. But what if your colleague made a mistake? The Web sites of the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> and other major newspapers list closings for “the Dow,” so it is reasonably easy for you to look up the numbers and verify them independently.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Names</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s03_p01">There is no more embarrassing error in business writing than to misspell someone’s name. To the writer, and to some readers, spelling a name “Michelle” instead of “Michele” may seem like a minor matter, but to Michele herself it will make a big difference. Attribution is one way we often involve a person’s name, and giving credit where credit is due is essential. There are many other reasons for including someone’s name, but regardless of your reasons for choosing to focus on them, you need to make sure the spelling is correct. Incorrect spelling of names is a quick way to undermine your credibility; it can also have a negative impact on your organization’s reputation, and in some cases it may even have legal ramifications.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Spelling</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s04_p01">Correct spelling is another element essential for your credibility, and errors will be glaringly obvious to many readers. The negative impact on your reputation as a writer, and its perception that you lack attention to detail or do not value your work, will be hard to overcome. In addition to the negative personal consequences, spelling errors can become factual errors and destroy the value of content. This may lead you to click the “spell check” button in your word processing program, but computer spell-checking is not enough. Spell checkers have improved in the years since they were first invented, but they are not infallible. They can and do make mistakes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s04_p02">Typically, your incorrect word may in fact be a word, and therefore, according to the program, correct. For example, suppose you wrote, “The major will attend the meeting” when you meant to write “The mayor will attend the meeting.” The program would miss this error because “major” is a word, but your meaning would be twisted beyond recognition.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Punctuation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s05_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Punctuation marks</a><span class="glossdef">The traffic signals, signs, and indications that allow us to navigate the written word.</span></span> are the traffic signals, signs, and indications that allow us to navigate the written word. They serve to warn us in advance when a transition is coming or the complete thought has come to an end. A period indicates the thought is complete, while a comma signals that additional elements or modifiers are coming. Correct signals will help your reader follow the thoughts through sentences and paragraphs, and enable you to communicate with maximum efficiency while reducing the probability of error.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn07_001">Strunk, W., Jr., &amp; White, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s05_p03">It may be daunting to realize that the number of possible punctuation errors is as extensive as the number of symbols and constructions available to the author. Software program may catch many punctuation errors, but again it is the committed writer that makes the difference. Here we will provide details on how to avoid mistakes with three of the most commonly used punctuation marks: the comma, the semicolon, and the apostrophe.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s05_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Commas</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s05_s01_p01">The comma is probably the most versatile of all punctuation marks. This means you as a writer can use your judgment in many cases as to whether you need a comma or not. It also means that the possible errors involving commas are many. Commas are necessary some of the time, but careless writers often place a comma in a sentence where it is simply not needed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s02_s05_s01_p02">Commas are used to separate two independent clauses joined by a conjunction like “but,” “and,” and “or.”</p>
