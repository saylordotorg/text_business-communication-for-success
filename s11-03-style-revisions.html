    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_p01">You know the difference between cloudy and clear water, but can you tell when your writing is cloudy, when meaning is hidden in shadows, when the message you are trying to communicate is obscured by the style you use to present it? Water filtration involves removing particulates, harmful inorganic and organic materials, and clarifying the water. In the same way, the revision process requires filtration. You may come across word choices you thought were appropriate at the time or notice words you thought you wrote but are absent, and the revision process will start to produce results. Some words and sentence constructions will be harmful to the effective delivery and require attention. Some transitions fail to show the connections between thoughts and need to be changed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_p02">Another way of conceptualizing the revision process in general and the clarifying process specifically is the common reference to a diamond in the rough. Like muddy water, diamonds do not come to have significant value until they have had their rough edges removed, have received expert polish, and been evaluated for clarity. Your attention to this important process will bring the value quotient of your writing up as it begins to more accurately communicate intended meaning. As we’ve discussed before, now is not the time to lose momentum. Just the opposite, now is the time to make your writing shine.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_p03">Here we will discuss several strategies to help clarify your writing style. If you have made wise word choices, the then next step to clarifying your document is to take it sentence by sentence. Each sentence should stand on its own, but each sentence is also interdependent on all other sentences in your document. These strategies will require significant attention to detail and an awareness of grammar that might not be your area of strength, but the more you practice them the more they will become good habits that will enhance your writing.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Break Up Long Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s01_p01">By revising long sentences you can often increase the overall clarity of your document. To do this, let’s start off with one strategy that will produce immediate results. Count the number of conjunctions in your document. Word processing programs will often perform a search for a specific a word and for our use, “and” will do just fine. Simple sentences often become compound and complex through the use of the word “and.” The further the subject, the action, and the modifiers or descriptions are from one another is directly related to the complexity of the sentence, increasing the probability of reader error and misunderstandings. Look for the word “and” and evaluate whether the sentence has two complete thoughts or ideas. Does it try to join two dissimilar ideas or ones better off on their own?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s01_p02">In prose, and your expository writing classes, you may have learned that complex sentences can communicate emotions, settings, and scenes that evoke a sense of place and time with your reading audience. In business writing, our goals aim more toward precision and the elimination of error; a good business document won’t read like a college essay. A professor may have advised you to avoid short, choppy writing. Are we asking you to do something along those lines? No. Choppy writing is hard to follow, but simple, clear writing does the job with a minimum of fuss and without decoration.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s01_p03">In their best-selling book <em class="emphasis">The Elements of Style</em>, William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn07_003">Strunk, W., Jr., &amp; White, E. B. (1979). <em class="emphasis">The elements of style</em> (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Macmillian.</span> emphasize clarity as a central goal. However, the following is one of their rules: “Do not break sentences in two.” As effective business writers we would agree with this rule, and while it may seem to contradict the preceding paragraph, let’s consider what they mean by that rule. They encourage writers to avoid sentence fragments by refraining from using a period where the sentence needs a comma. That means that an independent clause should be connected to a dependent clause when necessary, and as we’ve discussed previously, a comma and a conjunction are appropriate for the task. The sentence fragment cannot stand alone, so we would agree with the rule as written.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s01_p04">But we would also qualify its use: when you have two long and awkward independent clauses that form an unwieldy sentence, it may indeed be better to divide the clauses into two independent sentences. Your skill as a business writer is required to balance the needs of the sentence to communicate meaning with your understanding of audience expectations, and clarity often involves concise sentences.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Revise Big Words and Long Phrases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s02_p01">Big words can clutter your writing with needless jargon that may be a barrier to many readers. Even if you know your audience has significant education and training in a field, you may need to include definitions and examples as effective strategies to communicate meaning. Don’t confuse simple writing with simplistic writing. Your task will almost certainly not require an elementary approach for new readers, but it may very well require attention to words and the degree to which they contribute to, or detract from, the communication of your intended message. Long noun sequences, often used as descriptive phrases, can be one example of how writing can reduce clarity. If you need to describe a noun, use a phrase that modifies the noun clearly, with commas to offset for example, to enhance clarity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s02_p02">Another long phrase to watch out for is often located in the introduction. Long preambles can make the sentence awkward and will require revision. Sentences that start with “It is” or “There are” can often be shortened or made clearer through revision.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Evaluate Long Prepositional Phrases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s03_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prepositional phrase</a><span class="glossdef">A phrase composed of a preposition and its object, which may be a noun, a pronoun, or a clause.</span></span> is a phrase composed of a preposition (a “where” word; a word that indicates location) and its object, which may be a noun, a pronoun, or a clause. Some examples of simple prepositional phrases include “with Tom,” “before me,” and “inside the building security perimeter.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s03_p02">Prepositional phrases are necessary—it would be difficult to write without them—but some add to the bottom line word count without adding much to the sentence. Bureaucratic writing often uses this technique in an attempt to make a sentence sound important, but the effort usually has the undesirable dual effects of obscuring meaning and sounding pompous.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s03_p03">The revision places an adverb in place of a long prepositional phrase and allows for a reduction in the word count while strengthening the sentence.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Delete Repetitious Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s04_p01">Some level of repetition is to be expected and can be beneficial. It is also important to be consistent in your use of words when precise terminology is appropriate. However, needless repetition can make your document less than vigorous and discourage readers. For example, use of the word “said” when attributing dialogue is acceptable a couple of times, but if it is the only word you use, it will lose its impact quickly. People can “indicate,” “point out,” “share,” and “mention” as easily as they can “say” words or phrases. Synonyms are useful in avoiding the boredom of repetition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Eliminate Archaic Expressions or References</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s05_p01">Some writing has been ritualized to the point of cliché and has lost its impact. For example, consider “Heretofore, we have discussed the goal of omitting needless words.” <em class="emphasis">Heretofore</em> is an outdated word that could easily be cut from the previous sentence. Another example is “as per your request for documents that emphasize clarity and reduce reader error.” Feel free to eliminate <em class="emphasis">as per your request</em> from your word choices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s05_p02">Similar to outdated words and phrases, some references are equally outdated. While it is important to recognize leaders in a field, and this text does include references to pioneers in the field of communication, it also focuses on current research and concepts. Without additional clarification and examples, readers may not understand references to an author long since passed even though he or she made an important contribution to the field. For example, Shannon and Weaver pioneered the linear model of communication that revolutionized our understanding of interaction and contributed to computer interfaces as we know them today.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn07_004">McLean, S. (2005). <em class="emphasis">The basics of interpersonal communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> However, if we mention them without explaining how their work relates to our current context, we may lose our readers. Similarly, references to films like <em class="emphasis">My Fair Lady</em> may well be less understood than the use of <em class="emphasis">The Princess Diaries</em> as an example of the transformative process the lead characters undergo, from rough, street-smart women to formally educated, polished members of the elite.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Avoid Fillers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s06_p01">Like, you know, like, you know what I mean, ahh, umm, and all the fillers you may use or hear in oral communication have, well, little or no place in the written representation of the spoken word. Review your writing for extra words that serve the written equivalent of “like” and omit them. They do not serve you as an author, and do not serve the reading audience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Eliminate Slang</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s07_p01">Many college professors can give examples of e-mails they have received from students that use all the modern characteristics of instant message and text abbreviation combined with a complete disregard for any norms of grammar or spelling, resulting in nearly incomprehensible messages. If your goal is to be professional, and the audience expectations do not include the use of slang, then it is inappropriate to include it in your document. Eliminate slang as you would a jargon term that serves as a barrier to understanding meaning. Not everyone will understand your slang word no more than they would a highly specialized term, and it will defeat your purpose. Norms for capitalization and punctuation that are routinely abandoned in efficient text messages or tweets are necessary and required in professional documents. Finally, there is no place in reputable business writing for offensive slang or profanity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Evaluate Clichés</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s08_p01">Clichés are words or phrases that through their overuse have lost their impact. That definition does not imply they have lost their meaning, and sometimes a well-placed cliché can communicate a message effectively. “Actions speak louder than words” is a cliché, but its five words speak volumes that many of your readers will recognize. This appeal to familiarity can be an effective strategy to communicate, but use it carefully. Excessive reliance on clichés will make your writing trite, while eliminating them altogether may not serve you well either. As an effective business writer, you will need to evaluate your use of clichés for their impact versus detraction from your message.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s09">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Emphasize Precise Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s09_p01">Concrete words that are immediately available to your audience are often more effective than abstract terms that require definitions, examples, and qualifications. All these strategies have their place, but excessive use of abstractions will make your document less than precise, requiring additional clarification that can translate to work for you as the author and, more importantly, for your readers. Qualifiers deserve special mention here. Some instructors may indicate that words like “may,” “seems,” or “apparently” make your writing weak. Words are just words and it is how we use them that creates meaning. Some qualifiers are necessary, particularly if the document serves as record or may be the point of discussion in a legal issue. In other cases direct language is required, and qualifiers must be eliminated. Too many qualifiers can weaken your writing, but too few can expose you to liability. As a business writer, your understanding of audience expectations and assignment requirements will guide you to the judicious use of qualifiers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s10">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Evaluate Parallel Construction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s10_p01">When you are writing in a series or have more than one idea to express, it is important to present them in similar ways to preserve and promote unity across your document. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Parallel construction</a><span class="glossdef">The use of the same grammatical pattern; it can be applied to words, phrases, and sentences.</span></span> refers to the use of same grammatical pattern; it can be applied to words, phrases, and sentences. For example, “We found the seminar interesting, entertaining, and inspiring” is a sentence with parallel construction, whereas “We found the seminar interesting, entertaining, and it inspired us” is not. If your sentences do not seem to flow well, particularly when you read them out loud, look for misplaced parallels and change them to make the construction truly parallel.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s11">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Obscured Verbs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s11_p01">Business writing should be clear and concise. If the meaning is obscured, then revision is required. One common problem is the conversion of verbs into nouns with the addition of suffixes like: -ant,-ent, -ion, -tion, -sion, -ence, -ance, and ing. Instead of hiding meaning within the phrase “through the consolidation of,” consider whether to use the verb forms “consolidated” or “consolidating.” Similarly, instead of “the inclusion of,” consider using “including,” which will likely make the sentence more active and vigorous.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s12">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The “Is It Professional?” Test</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s03_s12_p01">Finally, when revising your document with an attention to detail, you simply need to ask the question: is it professional? If a document is too emphatic, it may seem like an attempt at cheerleading. If it uses too much jargon, it may be appropriate for “nerds” but may limit access to the information by a nontechnical audience. If the document appears too simplistic, it may seem to be “talking down” to the audience, treating the readers more like children than adults. Does your document represent you and your organization in a professional manner? Will you be proud of the work a year from now? Does it accomplish its mission, stated objectives, and the audience’s expectations? Business writing is not expository, wordy, or decorative, and the presence of these traits may obscure meaning. Business writing is professional, respectful, and clearly communicates a message with minimal breakdown.</p>
