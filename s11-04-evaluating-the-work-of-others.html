        <h2 class="title editable block">Five Steps in Evalution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s01_p01">By following a sequence of orderly steps, you can increase the likelihood that your evaluation of someone else’s writing will be fair, constructive, and useful. Below are the five steps in evaluation:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Understand the assignment.</li>
            <li>Evaluate how well the writing carries out the assignment.</li>
            <li>Evaluate assertions.</li>
            <li>Check facts.</li>
            <li>Look for errors.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s01_p02">First, review the instructions that were given to the writer. Make sure you understand the assignment and the target audience. What resources did the writer have access to, and how much time was allotted for completing the assignment? What purpose did the document need to fulfill, and what role will this document have in future business activities or decisions?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s01_p03">Second, evaluate how well the document fulfills its stated goals. As a reader, do you see the goals carried out in the document? If you didn’t know the writer and you were to find the document next year in a file where you were searching for information, would it provide you with the information it aims to convey? For example, suppose the document refers to the sales history of the past five years. Does the writer provide the sales history for the reader’s reference, or indicate where the reader can get this information?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s01_p04">Evaluate the assertions made in the document. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assertion</a><span class="glossdef">A declaration, a statement of fact, or claim of fact.</span></span> is a declaration, statement, or claim of fact. Suppose the writer indicates that the sales history for the past five years is a significant factor. Does the writer explain why this history is significant? Is the explanation logical and sufficient?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s01_p05">Evaluate the facts cited in the document. Does the writer credit the sources of facts, statistics, and numbers? For example, suppose the writer mentions that the population of the United States is approximately three hundred million. Obviously, the writer did not count all U.S. residents to arrive at this number. Where did it come from? If you have access to sources where you can independently verify the accuracy of these details, look them up and note any discrepancies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s01_p06">Finally, check the document for proper format and for errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Word processing spell checkers do not catch all errors.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Delivering the Evaluation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s02_p01">If you are asked to evaluate someone else’s written work, keep in mind that not everyone can separate process from product, or product from personality. Many authors, particularly those new to the writing process, see the written word as an extension of self. To help the recipient receive your evaluation as professional advice, rather than as personal criticism, use strategies to be tactful and diplomatic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s02_p02">Until you know the author and have an established relationship, it is best to use “I” statements, as in “I find this sentence difficult to understand.” The sentence places the emphasis on the speaker rather than the sentence, and further distances the author from the sentence. If you were to say, “This sentence is awful,” all the author may hear is, “I am an awful writer” and fail to pay attention to your message, the sentence under examination, or ways to improve it. Business writing produces products, and all products can be improved, but not all authors can separate messenger from message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s02_p03">Avoid the use of the word <em class="emphasis">you</em> in your evaluation, oral or written, as it can put the recipient on the defensive. This will inhibit listening and decrease the probability of effective communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn07_005">McLean, S. (2005). <em class="emphasis">The basics of interpersonal communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> If you phrase an evaluation point as, “Why did you include this word here?” it can be interpreted as a personal attack. Just as speakers are often quite self-conscious of their public speaking abilities, writers are often quite attached to the works they have produced. Anticipating and respecting this relationship and the anxiety it sometimes carries can help you serve as a better evaluator.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s02_p04">Phrasing disagreement as a question is often an effective response strategy. Let’s rephrase that previous question to, “What is this sentence intended to communicate?” This places the emphasis on the sentence, not the author, and allows for dialogue. Phrasing your evaluation as a question emphasizes your need to understand, and provides the author with space to respond in a collaborative fashion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s02_p05">Focus on the document as a product, an “it,” and avoid associating the author or authors with it. There may be times when the social rank or status of the individual involved with work requires respectful consideration, and choosing to focus on the document as a work in progress, distinct from authors themselves, can serve you well. This also means that at times you may notice a glaring error but be reluctant to challenge the author directly as you anticipate a less than collaborative response. By treating the document as a product, and focusing on ways to strengthen it, keeping in mind our goals of clear and concise as reference points, you can approach issues without involving personalities.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch07_s04_s02_p06">When evaluating the work of others, make sure you understand the assignment, evaluate how well the writing carries out the assignment, evaluate assertions, check facts, and watch for errors. Deliver your evaluation with tact and diplomacy.</p>

                <li>Select a piece of writing from a Web site, book, newspaper, or magazine. Imagine that you are delivering an evaluation to the author of the piece. Using the strategies in this section, write a tactful and diplomatic critique. Your instructor may choose to make this a class exercise, asking students to exchange papers and evaluate each others’ writing.</li>
                <li>Select a piece of writing from a Web site, book, newspaper, or magazine. Imagine that you are editing it half its original length. Share the article and your revised copy with your classmates.</li>
                <li>What responsibility do you have to point out the need for correction in a document when the author or team leader outranks you at work? Does it make a difference if you anticipate they will take the feedback negatively? How do you reconcile these concerns with your responsibility to the organization? Share and discuss your responses with your classmates.</li>
