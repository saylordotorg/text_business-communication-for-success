        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">memo</a><span class="glossdef">An abbreviation for memorandum; normally used for communicating policies, procedures, or related official business within an organization.</span></span> (or memorandum, meaning “reminder”) is normally used for communicating policies, procedures, or related official business within an organization. It is often written from a one-to-all perspective (like mass communication), broadcasting a message to an audience, rather than a one-on-one, interpersonal communication. It may also be used to update a team on activities for a given project, or to inform a specific group within a company of an event, action, or observance.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Memo Purpose</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">A memo’s purpose is often to inform, but it occasionally includes an element of persuasion or a call to action. All organizations have informal and formal communication networks. The unofficial, informal communication network within an organization is often called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grapevine</a><span class="glossdef">The unofficial, informal communication network within an organization, often characterized by rumor, gossip, and innuendo.</span></span>, and it is often characterized by rumor, gossip, and innuendo. On the grapevine, one person may hear that someone else is going to be laid off and start passing the news around. Rumors change and transform as they are passed from person to person, and before you know it, the word is that they are shutting down your entire department.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p02">One effective way to address informal, unofficial speculation is to spell out clearly for all employees what is going on with a particular issue. If budget cuts are a concern, then it may be wise to send a memo explaining the changes that are imminent. If a company wants employees to take action, they may also issue a memorandum. For example, on February 13, 2009, upper management at the Panasonic Corporation issued a declaration that all employees should buy at least $1,600 worth of Panasonic products. The company president noted that if everyone supported the company with purchases, it would benefit all.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn09_004">Lewis, L. (2009, February 13). <em class="emphasis">Panasonic orders staff to buy £1,000 in products</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p03">While memos do not normally include a call to action that requires personal spending, they often represent the business or organization’s interests. They may also include statements that align business and employee interest, and underscore common ground and benefit.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Memo Format</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p01">A memo has a header that clearly indicates who sent it and who the intended recipients are. Pay particular attention to the title of the individual(s) in this section. Date and subject lines are also present, followed by a message that contains a declaration, a discussion, and a summary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p02">In a standard writing format, we might expect to see an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. All these are present in a memo, and each part has a clear purpose. The declaration in the opening uses a declarative sentence to announce the main topic. The discussion elaborates or lists major points associated with the topic, and the conclusion serves as a summary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p03">Let’s examine a sample memo.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Audience Orientation</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s03_s01_p01">Always consider the audience and their needs when preparing a memo. An acronym or abbreviation that is known to management may not be known by all the employees of the organization, and if the memo is to be posted and distributed within the organization, the goal is clear and concise communication at all levels with no ambiguity.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s03_s02_p01">Memos are often announcements, and the person sending the memo speaks for a part or all of the organization. While it may contain a request for feedback, the announcement itself is linear, from the organization to the employees. The memo may have legal standing as it often reflects policies or procedures, and may reference an existing or new policy in the employee manual, for example.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s03_s03">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Subject Emphasis</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s03_s03_p01">The subject is normally declared in the subject line and should be clear and concise. If the memo is announcing the observance of a holiday, for example, the specific holiday should be named in the subject line—for example, use “Thanksgiving weekend schedule” rather than “holiday observance.”</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s01_s03_s04_p01">Some written business communication allows for a choice between direct and indirect formats, but memorandums are always direct. The purpose is clearly announced.</p>

Shorter messages may include e-mails or memos, either hard copy or electronic, while reports tend to be three or more pages in length.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s02_p02">While e-mail and text messages may be used more frequently today, the effective business letter remains a common form of written communication. It can serve to introduce you to a potential employer, announce a product or service, or even serve to communicate feelings and emotions. We’ll examine the basic outline of a letter and then focus on specific products or writing assignments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s02_p03">All writing assignments have expectations in terms of language and format. The audience or reader may have their own idea of what constitutes a specific type of letter, and your organization may have its own format and requirements. This chapter outlines common elements across letters, and attention should be directed to the expectations associated with your particular writing assignment. There are many types of letters, and many adaptations in terms of form and content, but in this chapter, we discuss the fifteen elements of a traditional block-style letter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s02_s02_p04">Letters may serve to introduce your skills and qualifications to prospective employers, deliver important or specific information, or serve as documentation of an event or decision. Regardless of the type of letter you need to write, it can contain up to fifteen elements in five areas. While you may not use all the elements in every case or context, they are listed in <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch09_s02_s02_t01">Table 9.1 "Elements of a Business Letter"</a>.</p>

A comma after the salutation is correct for personal letters, but a colon should be used in business. The salutation “To whom it may concern” is appropriate for letters of recommendation or other letters that are intended to be read by any and all individuals. If this is not the case with your letter, but you are unsure of how to address your recipient, make every effort to find out to whom the letter should be specifically addressed. For many, there is no sweeter sound than that of their name, and to spell it incorrectly runs the risk of alienating the reader before your letter has even been read. Avoid the use of impersonal salutations like “Dear Prospective Customer,” as the lack of personalization can alienate a future client.</td>

An emphatic opening involves using the most significant or important element of the letter in the introduction. Readers tend to pay attention to openings, and it makes sense to outline the expectations for the reader up front.

Readers may skip over information in the body of your letter, so make sure you emphasize the key points clearly. This is your core content, where you can outline and support several key points.

The conclusion can serve to remind the reader, but should not introduce new information. A clear summary sentence will strengthen your writing and enhance your effectiveness. If your letter requests or implies action, the conclusion needs to make clear what you expect to happen. It is usually courteous to conclude by thanking the recipient for his or her attention, and to invite them to contact you if you can be of help or if they have questions.
