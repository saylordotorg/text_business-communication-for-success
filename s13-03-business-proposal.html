    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_p01">An effective business proposal informs and persuades efficiently. It features many of the common elements of a report, but its emphasis on persuasion guides the overall presentation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_p02">Let’s say you work in a health care setting. What types of products or services might be put out to bid? If your organization is going to expand and needs to construct a new wing, it will probably be put out to bid. Everything from office furniture to bedpans could potentially be put out to bid, specifying a quantity, quality, and time of delivery required. Janitorial services may also be bid on each year, as well as food services, and even maintenance. Using the power of bidding to lower contract costs for goods and services is common practice.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_p03">In order to be successful in business and industry, you should be familiar with the business proposal. Much like a report, with several common elements and persuasive speech, a business proposal makes the case for your product or service. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Business proposals</a><span class="glossdef">Document designed to make a persuasive appeal to the audience to achieve a defined outcome, often proposing a solution to a problem.</span></span> are documents designed to make a persuasive appeal to the audience to achieve a defined outcome, often proposing a solution to a problem.</p>

        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Idea</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p01">Effective business proposals are built around a great idea or solution. While you may be able to present your normal product, service, or solution in an interesting way, you want your document and its solution to stand out against the background of competing proposals. What makes your idea different or unique? How can you better meet the needs of the company that other vendors? What makes you so special? If the purchase decision is made solely on price, it may leave you little room to underscore the value of service, but the sale follow-through has value. For example, don’t consider just the cost of the unit but also its maintenance. How can maintenance be a part of your solution, distinct from the rest? In addition, your proposal may focus on a common product where you can anticipate several vendors at similar prices. How can you differentiate yourself from the rest by underscoring long-term relationships, demonstrated ability to deliver, or the ability to anticipate the company’s needs? Business proposals need to have an attractive idea or solution in order to be effective.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Traditional Categories</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s02_p01">You can be creative in many aspects of the business proposal, but follow the traditional categories. Businesses expect to see information in a specific order, much like a résumé or even a letter. Each aspect of your proposal has its place and it is to your advantage to respect that tradition and use the categories effectively to highlight your product or service. Every category is an opportunity to sell, and should reinforce your credibility, your passion, and the reason why your solution is simply the best.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s03_p01">Ethos refers to credibility, pathos to passion and enthusiasm, and logos to logic or reason. All three elements are integral parts of your business proposal that require your attention. Who are you and why should we do business with you? Your credibility may be unknown to the potential client and it is your job to reference previous clients, demonstrate order fulfillment, and clearly show that your product or service is offered by a credible organization. By association, if your organization is credible the product or service is often thought to be more credible.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s03_p02">In the same way, if you are not enthusiastic about the product or service, why should the potential client get excited? How does your solution stand out in the marketplace? Why should they consider you? Why should they continue reading? Passion and enthusiasm are not only communicated through “!” exclamation points. Your thorough understanding, and your demonstration of that understanding, communicates dedication and interest.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s03_p03">Each assertion requires substantiation, each point clear support. It is not enough to make baseless claims about your product or service—you have to show why the claims you make are true, relevant, and support your central assertion that your product or service is right for this client. Make sure you cite sources and indicate “according to” when you support your points. Be detailed and specific.</p>

        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Professional</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s04_p01">A professional document is a base requirement. If it is less than professional, you can count on its prompt dismissal. There should be no errors in spelling or grammar, and all information should be concise, accurate, and clearly referenced when appropriate. Information that pertains to credibility should be easy to find and clearly relevant, including contact information. If the document exists in a hard copy form, it should be printed on a letterhead. If the document is submitted in an electronic form, it should be in a file format that presents your document as you intended. Word processing files may have their formatting changed or adjusted based on factors you cannot control—like screen size—and information can shift out of place, making it difficult to understand. In this case, a portable document format (PDF)—a format for electronic documents—may be used to preserve content location and avoid any inadvertent format changes when it is displayed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s01_s04_p02">Effective, persuasive proposals are often brief, even limited to one page. “The one-page proposal has been one of the keys to my business success, and it can be invaluable to you too. Few decision-makers can ever afford to read more than one page when deciding if they are interested in a deal or not. This is even more true for people of a different culture or language,” said Adnan Khashoggi, a successful multibillionaire.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn09_006">Riley, P. G. (2002). <em class="emphasis">The one-page proposal: How to get your business pitch onto one persuasive page</em> (p. 2).

        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Solicited</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s02_s01_p01">If you have been asked to submit a proposal it is considered solicited. The solicitation may come in the form of a direct verbal or written request, but normally solicitations are indirect, open-bid to the public, and formally published for everyone to see. A request for proposal (RFP), request for quotation (RFQ), and invitation for bid (IFB) are common ways to solicit business proposals for business, industry, and the government.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s02_s01_p02">RFPs typically specify the product or service, guidelines for submission, and evaluation criteria. RFQs emphasize cost, though service and maintenance may be part of the solicitation. IRBs are often job-specific in that they encompass a project that requires a timeline, labor, and materials. For example, if a local school district announces the construction of a new elementary school, they normally have the architect and engineering plans on file, but need a licensed contractor to build it.</p>

        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Unsolicited</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s03_s02_s02_p01">Unsolicited proposals are the “cold calls” of business writing. They require a thorough understanding of the market, product and/or service, and their presentation is typically general rather than customer-specific. They can, however, be tailored to specific businesses with time and effort, and the demonstrated knowledge of specific needs or requirement can transform an otherwise generic, brochure-like proposal into an effective sales message. Getting your tailored message to your target audience, however, is often a significant challenge if it has not been directly or indirectly solicited. Unsolicited proposals are often regarded as marketing materials, intended more to stimulate interest for a follow-up contact than make direct sales. Sue Baugh and Robert Hamper encourage you to resist the temptation to “shoot at every target and hope you hit at least one.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn09_007">Baugh, L. S., &amp; Hamper, R. J. (1995). <em class="emphasis">Handbook for writing proposals</em> (p. 3). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</span> A targeted proposal is your most effective approach, but recognize the importance of gaining company, service, or brand awareness as well as its limitations.</p>

Follow the guidelines provided in the sample letter for CPA services on the American Institute of Public Accountants Web site. Do not include actual contact information. Just as the example has employees named after colors, your (imaginary) company should have contact information that does not directly link to real businesses or you as an individual. Do not respond to point 12.</li>

                <li>Identify a product or service you would like to produce or offer. List three companies that you would like to sell your product or service to and learn more about them. Post your findings, making the link between your product or service and company needs.
