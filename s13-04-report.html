        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is a Report?</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Reports</a><span class="glossdef">Document designed to record and convey information to the reader.</span></span> are documents designed to record and convey information to the reader. Reports are part of any business or organization; from credit reports to police reports, they serve to document specific information for specific audiences, goals, or functions. The type of report is often identified by its primary purpose or function, as in an accident report, a laboratory report, a sales report, or even a book report. Reports are often analytical, or involve the rational analysis of information. Sometimes they simply “report the facts” with no analysis at all, but still need to communicate the information in a clear and concise format. Other reports summarize past events, present current data, and forecast future trends. While a report may have conclusions, propositions, or even a call to action, the demonstration of the analysis is the primary function. A sales report, for example, is not designed to make an individual sale. It is, however, supposed to report sales to date, and may forecast future sales based on previous trends. This chapter is designed to introduce you to the basics of report writing.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Reports</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_p01">Reports come in all sizes, but are typically longer than a page and somewhat shorter than a book. The type of report depends on its function. The function of the report is its essential purpose, often indicated in the thesis or purpose statement. The function will also influence the types of visual content or visual aids, representing words, numbers, and their relationships to the central purpose in graphic, representational ways that are easy for the reader to understand. The function may also contribute to parameters like report length (page or word count) or word choice and readability. “Focusing on the content of your longer business documents is not only natural but necessary because doing so helps ensure complete, correct information.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn09_008">Bovee, C., &amp; Thill, J. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Business communication essentials: A skills-based approach to vital business English</em> (4th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_p02">Reports vary by function, and they also vary by style and tradition. Within your organization, there may be employer-specific expectations that need to be addressed to meet audience expectations. This chapter discusses reports in general terms, focusing on common elements and points of distinction, but reference to similar documents where you work or additional examination of specific sample reports may serve you well as you prepare your own report.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Informational or Analytical Report?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p01">There are two main categories for reports, regardless of their specific function or type. An informational report informs or instructs and presents details of events, activities, individuals, or conditions without analysis. An example of this type of “just the facts” report is a police accident report. The report will note the time, date, place, contributing factors like weather, and identification information for the drivers involved in an automobile accident. It does not establish fault or include judgmental statements. You should not see “Driver was falling down drunk” in a police accident report. Instead, you would see “Driver failed sobriety tests and breathalyzer test and was transported to the station for a blood sample.” The police officer is not a trained medical doctor and is therefore not licensed to make definitive diagnoses, but can collect and present relevant information that may contribute to that diagnosis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p02">The second type of report is called an analytical report. An analytical report presents information with a comprehensive analysis to solve problems, demonstrate relationships, or make recommendations. An example of this report may be a field report by a Center for Disease Control (CDC) physician from the site of an outbreak of the H1N1 virus, noting symptoms, disease progression, steps taken to arrest the spread of the disease, and to make recommendations on the treatment and quarantine of subjects.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p01">Reports vary by size, format, and function. You need to be flexible and adjust to the needs of the audience while respecting customs and guidelines. Reports are typically organized around six key elements:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Whom the report is about and/or prepared for</li>
                <li>What was done, what problems were addressed, and the results, including conclusions and/or recommendations</li>
                <li>Where the subject studied occurred</li>
                <li>When the subject studied occurred</li>
                <li>Why the report was written (function), including under what authority, for what reason, or by whose request</li>
                <li>How the subject operated, functioned, or was used</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p02">Pay attention to these essential elements when you consider your stakeholders, or those who have an interest in the report. That may include the person(s) the report is about, whom it is for, and the larger audience of the business, organization, or industry. Ask yourself who the key decision makers are who will read your report, who the experts or technicians will be, and how executives and workers may interpret your words and images. While there is no universal format for a report, there is a common order to the information. Each element supports the main purpose or function in its own way, playing an important role in the representation and transmission of information.</p>
