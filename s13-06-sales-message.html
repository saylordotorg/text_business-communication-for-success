    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s06_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sales message</a><span class="glossdef">The central persuasive message that intrigues, informs, persuades, calls to action, and closes the sale.</span></span> is the central persuasive message that intrigues, informs, persuades, calls to action, and closes the sale. Not every sales message will make a direct sale, but the goal remains. Whether your sales message is embedded in a letter, represented in a proposal, or broadcast across radio or television, the purpose stays the same.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s06_p02">Sales messages are often discussed in terms of reason versus emotion. Every message has elements of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethos</a><span class="glossdef">Credibility.</span></span>, or credibility; <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pathos</a><span class="glossdef">Passion and enthusiasm.</span></span>, or passion and enthusiasm; and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">logos</a><span class="glossdef">Logic and reason.</span></span>, or logic and reason. If your sales message focuses exclusively on reason with cold, hard facts and nothing but the facts, you may appeal to some audience, but certainly not the majority. Buyers make purchase decisions on emotion as well as reason, and even if they have researched all the relevant facts about competing products, the decision may still come down to impulse, emotion, and desire. If your sales message focuses exclusively on emotion, with little or no substance, it may not be taken seriously. Finally, if your sales message does not appear to have credibility, the message will be dismissed. In the case of the sales message, you need to meet the audience’s needs that vary greatly.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s06_p03">In general, appeals to emotion pique curiosity and get our attention, but some attention to reason and facts should also be included. That doesn’t mean we need to spell out the technical manual on the product on the opening sale message, but basic information about design or features, in specific, concrete ways can help an audience make sense of your message and the product or service. Avoid using too many abstract terms or references, as not everyone will understand these. You want your sales message to do the work, not the audience.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sales Message Strategies for Success</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s06_s02_p01">Your product or service may sell itself, but if you require a sales message, you may want to consider these strategies for success:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s06_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Start with your greatest benefit</strong>. Use it in the headline, subject line, caption, or attention statement. Audiences tend to remember the information from the beginning and end of a message, but have less recall about the middle points. Make your first step count by highlighting the best feature first.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take baby steps</strong>. One thing at a time. Promote, inform, and persuade on one product or service at a time. You want to hear “yes” and make the associated sale, and if you confuse the audience with too much information, too many options, steps to consider, or related products or service, you are more likely to hear “no” as a defensive response as the buyer tries not to make a mistake. Avoid confusion and keep it simple.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Know your audience</strong>. The more background research you can do on your buyer, the better you can anticipate their specific wants and needs and individualize your sales message to meet them.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Lead with emotion, follow with reason</strong>. Gain the audience’s attention with drama, humor, or novelty and follow with specific facts that establish your credibility, provide more information about the product or service, and lead to your call to action to make the sale.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch09_s06_s02_p02">These four steps can help improve your sales message, and your sales. Invest your time in planning and preparation, and consider the audience’s needs as you prepare your sales message.</p>
