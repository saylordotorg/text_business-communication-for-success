    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_p01">In the classical tradition, the art of public speaking is called rhetoric; the circumstances in which you give your speech or presentation are the rhetorical situation. By understanding the rhetorical situation, you can gauge the best ways to reach your listeners and get your points across. In so doing, you’ll make the transition from your viewpoint to that of your audience members. Remember that without an audience to listen and respond to you, it’s really not much of a speech. The audience gives you the space and time as a speaker to fulfill your role and, hopefully, their expectations. Just as a group makes a leader, an audience makes a speaker. By looking to your audience, you shift your attention from an internal focus (you) to an external (them/others) emphasis. This “other-orientation” is key to your success as an effective speaker.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_p02">Several of the first questions any audience member asks himself or herself are, “Why should I listen to you?” “What does what you are saying have to do with me?” and “How does this help me?” We communicate through the lens of personal experience and it’s only natural that we would relate what others say to our own needs and wants, but by recognizing that we share in our humanity many of the same basic motivations, we can find common ground of mutual interest. Generating interest in your speech is only the first step as you guide perception through selection, organization, and interpretation of content and ways to communicate your point. Your understanding of the rhetorical situation will guide you as you plan how to employ various strategies to guide your listeners as they perceive and interpret your message. Your awareness of the overall process of building a speech will allow you to take it step by step and focus on the immediate task at hand.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetorical situation</a><span class="glossdef">Involves three elements: the set of expectations inherent in the context, the audience, and the purpose of your speech or presentation.</span></span> involves three elements: the set of expectations inherent in the context, audience, and the purpose of your speech or presentation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn12_001">Kostelnick, C., &amp; Roberts, D. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Designing visual language: Strategies for professional communicators</em>. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> This means you need to consider, in essence, the “who, what, where, when, why, and how” of your speech from the audience’s perspective.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Context</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01_p01">As we consider the rhetorical situation, we need to explore the concept in depth. Your speech is not given in a space that has no connection to the rest of the world. If you are going to be presenting a speech in class, your context will be the familiar space of your classroom. Other contexts might include a business conference room, a restaurant where you are the featured speaker for a dinner meeting, or a podium that has been set up outdoors for a sports award ceremony.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01_p02">The time of your speech will relate to people’s natural patterns of behavior. If you give a speech right after lunch, you can expect people to be a bit sleepy. Knowing this, you can take steps to counter this element of the context by making your presentation especially dynamic, such as having your audience get up from their seats or calling on them to answer questions at various points in your speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01_p03">You can also place your topic within the frame of reference of current events. If you are presenting a speech on the importance of access to health care for everyone, and you are presenting it in October of an election year, the current events that exist outside your speech may be used to enhance it. Your listeners might be very aware of the political climate, and relating your topic to a larger context may effectively take into consideration the circumstances in which your readers will use, apply, or contemplate your information.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s02_p01">The receiver (i.e., listener or audience) is one of the basic components of communication. Without a receiver, the source (i.e., the speaker) has only himself or herself in which to send the message. By extension, without an audience you can’t have a speech. Your audience comes to you with expectations, prior knowledge, and experience. They have a purpose that makes them part of the audience instead of outside playing golf. They have a wide range of characteristics like social class, gender, age, race and ethnicity, cultural background, and language that make them unique and diverse. What kind of audience will you be speaking to? What do you know about their expectations, prior knowledge or backgrounds, and how they plan to use your information? Giving attention to this aspect of the rhetorical situation will allow you to gain insight into how to craft your message before you present it.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Purpose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s03_p01">A speech or oral presentation may be designed to inform, demonstrate, persuade, motivate, or even entertain. You may also overlap by design and both inform and persuade. The purpose of your speech is central to its formation. You should be able to state your purpose in one sentence or less, much like an effective thesis statement in an essay. You also need to consider alternate perspectives, as we’ve seen previously in this chapter. Your purpose may be to persuade, but the audience after lunch may want to be entertained, and your ability to adapt can make use of a little entertainment that leads to persuasion.</p>

                <li>Is it important to consider the rhetorical situation? Why or why not? Discuss your opinion with a classmate.</li>
                <li>Think of an example (real or hypothetical) of a speech, a sales presentation, a news broadcast or television program. Using the elements listed in this section of the chapter, describe the rhetorical situation present in your example. Present your example to the class.</li>
                <li>Let’s take the topic of tattoos. Imagine you are going to present two informative speeches about tattoos: one to a group of middle school children, and the other to a group of college students. How would you adapt your topic for each audience and why? Write your results, provide an example or explanation, and discuss with classmates.</li>
                <li>Examine a communication interaction and identify the context, the audience, and the purpose of the exchange. Write a brief description and share with classmates.</li>
                <li>You’ve been assigned the task of arranging a meeting for your class to discuss an important topic. How do context, audience, and purpose influence your decisions? Write a brief statement of what you would want in terms of time, location, setting, and scene and why. Please share your results with classmates.</li>
