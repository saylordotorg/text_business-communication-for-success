    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s05_p01">There are many different ways to organize a speech, and none is “better” or “more correct” than the others. The choice of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">organizing principle</a><span class="glossdef">A core assumption around which everything else is arranged.</span></span>, or a core assumption around which everything else is arranged, depends on the subject matter, the rhetorical situation, and many other factors, including your preference as speaker.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s05_p02">The left column of <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch12_s05_t01">Table 12.6 "Sample Organizing Principles for a Speech"</a> presents seventeen different organizing principles to consider. The center column explains how the principle works, and the right column provides an applied example based on our sample speech about the First Transcontinental Railroad. For example, using a biographical organizing principle, you might describe the journey of the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1804; the signing of the Pacific Railroad Act in 1862, and the completion of the first Transcontinental Express train trip in 1876. As another example, using a spatial organizing principle, you might describe the mechanics of how a steam locomotive engine works to turn the train wheels, which move on a track to travel across distances.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s05_p03">As you read each organizational structure, consider how the main points and subheadings might change or be adapted to meet each pattern.</p>
