        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s00_p01">In earlier stages of preparation for a speech, you have gained a good idea of who your audience is and what information you want to focus on. This chapter will help you consider how to organize the information to cover your topic. You may be tempted to think that you know enough about your topic that you can just “wing it” or go “freestyling.” Your organization might be something like this: “First, I’ll talk about this, then I’ll give this example, and I’ll wrap it up with this.” While knowledge on your topic is key to an effective speech, do not underestimate the importance of organization. You may start to give your speech thinking you’ll follow the “outline” in your mind, and then suddenly your mind will go blank. If it doesn’t go blank, you may finish what was planned as a five-minute speech with three minutes remaining, sit down, and then start to remember all the things you intended to say but didn’t. To your listeners, your presentation may have sounded like the first of the <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch12_n01">Note 12.1 "Introductory Exercises"</a> for this chapter—a bunch of related ideas that were scattered and unorganized.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s00_p02">Organization in your speech is helpful both to you and to your audience. Your audience will appreciate hearing the information presented in an organized way, and being well organized will make the speaking situation much less stressful for you. You might forget a point and be able to glance at your outline and get back on track. Your listeners will see that you took your responsibility as a speaker seriously and will be able to listen more attentively. They’ll be able to link your key points in their minds, and the result will be a more effective speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s00_p03">An extemporaneous speech involves flexibility and organization. You know your material. You are prepared and follow an outline. You do not read a script or PowerPoint presentation, you do not memorize every single word in order (though some parts may be memorized), but you also do not make it up as you go along. Your presentation is scripted in the sense that it is completely planned from start to finish, yet every word is not explicitly planned, allowing for some spontaneity and adaptation to the audience’s needs in the moment. This extemporaneous approach is the most common form used in business and industry today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s00_p04">Your organization plan will serve you and your audience as a guide, and help you present a more effective speech. If you are concerned with grades, it will no doubt help you improve your score as well. If you work in a career where your “grades” are sales, and a sales increase means getting an “A,” then your ability to organize will help you make the grade. Just as there is no substitute for practice and preparation, there is no substitute for organization and an outline when you need it the most: on stage. Do yourself and the audience a favor and create an outline with an organization pattern that best meets your needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s00_p05">In the 1991 film <em class="emphasis">What about Bob</em>? a psychiatrist presents the simple idea to the patient, played by actor Bill Murray. If the patient takes whatever he needs to do step by step, the process he once perceived as complex becomes simple. In this same way, your understanding of giving business presentations will develop step by step, as the process and its important elements unfold. Read and reflect on how each area might influence your speech, how it might involve or impact your audience, and how your purpose guides your strategies as you plan your speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s00_p06">If you take it step by step, presenting a speech can be an exhilarating experience not unlike winning a marathon or climbing a high peak. Every journey begins with a first step, and in terms of communication, you’ve already taken countless steps in your lifetime. Now we’ll take the next step and begin to analyze the process of public speaking.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">12.1</span> Rhetorical Situation</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch12_s01_l01">
            <li>Label and discuss the three main components of the rhetorical situation.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_p01">In the classical tradition, the art of public speaking is called rhetoric; the circumstances in which you give your speech or presentation are the rhetorical situation. By understanding the rhetorical situation, you can gauge the best ways to reach your listeners and get your points across. In so doing, you’ll make the transition from your viewpoint to that of your audience members. Remember that without an audience to listen and respond to you, it’s really not much of a speech. The audience gives you the space and time as a speaker to fulfill your role and, hopefully, their expectations. Just as a group makes a leader, an audience makes a speaker. By looking to your audience, you shift your attention from an internal focus (you) to an external (them/others) emphasis. This “other-orientation” is key to your success as an effective speaker.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_p02">Several of the first questions any audience member asks himself or herself are, “Why should I listen to you?” “What does what you are saying have to do with me?” and “How does this help me?” We communicate through the lens of personal experience and it’s only natural that we would relate what others say to our own needs and wants, but by recognizing that we share in our humanity many of the same basic motivations, we can find common ground of mutual interest. Generating interest in your speech is only the first step as you guide perception through selection, organization, and interpretation of content and ways to communicate your point. Your understanding of the rhetorical situation will guide you as you plan how to employ various strategies to guide your listeners as they perceive and interpret your message. Your awareness of the overall process of building a speech will allow you to take it step by step and focus on the immediate task at hand.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetorical situation</a><span class="glossdef">Involves three elements: the set of expectations inherent in the context, the audience, and the purpose of your speech or presentation.</span></span> involves three elements: the set of expectations inherent in the context, audience, and the purpose of your speech or presentation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn12_001">Kostelnick, C., &amp; Roberts, D. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Designing visual language: Strategies for professional communicators</em>. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> This means you need to consider, in essence, the “who, what, where, when, why, and how” of your speech from the audience’s perspective.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Context</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01_p01">As we consider the rhetorical situation, we need to explore the concept in depth. Your speech is not given in a space that has no connection to the rest of the world. If you are going to be presenting a speech in class, your context will be the familiar space of your classroom. Other contexts might include a business conference room, a restaurant where you are the featured speaker for a dinner meeting, or a podium that has been set up outdoors for a sports award ceremony.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01_p02">The time of your speech will relate to people’s natural patterns of behavior. If you give a speech right after lunch, you can expect people to be a bit sleepy. Knowing this, you can take steps to counter this element of the context by making your presentation especially dynamic, such as having your audience get up from their seats or calling on them to answer questions at various points in your speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s01_p03">You can also place your topic within the frame of reference of current events. If you are presenting a speech on the importance of access to health care for everyone, and you are presenting it in October of an election year, the current events that exist outside your speech may be used to enhance it. Your listeners might be very aware of the political climate, and relating your topic to a larger context may effectively take into consideration the circumstances in which your readers will use, apply, or contemplate your information.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s02_p01">The receiver (i.e., listener or audience) is one of the basic components of communication. Without a receiver, the source (i.e., the speaker) has only himself or herself in which to send the message. By extension, without an audience you can’t have a speech. Your audience comes to you with expectations, prior knowledge, and experience. They have a purpose that makes them part of the audience instead of outside playing golf. They have a wide range of characteristics like social class, gender, age, race and ethnicity, cultural background, and language that make them unique and diverse. What kind of audience will you be speaking to? What do you know about their expectations, prior knowledge or backgrounds, and how they plan to use your information? Giving attention to this aspect of the rhetorical situation will allow you to gain insight into how to craft your message before you present it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Purpose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s01_s03_p01">A speech or oral presentation may be designed to inform, demonstrate, persuade, motivate, or even entertain. You may also overlap by design and both inform and persuade. The purpose of your speech is central to its formation. You should be able to state your purpose in one sentence or less, much like an effective thesis statement in an essay. You also need to consider alternate perspectives, as we’ve seen previously in this chapter. Your purpose may be to persuade, but the audience after lunch may want to be entertained, and your ability to adapt can make use of a little entertainment that leads to persuasion.</p>

            <li>Identify and provide examples of at least five of the nine basic cognate strategies in communication.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_p01">Given the diverse nature of audiences, the complexity of the communication process, and the countless options and choices to make when preparing your speech, you may feel overwhelmed. One effective way to address this is to focus on ways to reach, interact, or stimulate your audience. Humans share many of the same basic needs, and meeting those needs provides various strategies for action.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_p02">Charles Kostelnick and David Roberts outline several <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cognate strategies</a><span class="glossdef">Ways of framing, expressing and representing a message to an audience.</span></span>, or ways of framing, expressing, and representing a message to an audience, in <em class="emphasis">Designing Visual Language: Strategies for Professional Communicators</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn12_002">Kostelnick, C., &amp; Roberts, D. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Designing visual language: Strategies for professional communicators</em>. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> The word “cognate” refers to knowledge, and these strategies are techniques to impart knowledge to your audience. Kostelnick and Roberts’s strategies are cross-disciplinary in that they can be applied to writing, graphic design, and verbal communication. They help the writer, designer, or speaker answer questions like “Does the audience understand how I’m arranging my information?” “Am I emphasizing my key points effectively?” and “How does my expression and representation of information contribute to a relationship with the audience?” They can serve you to better anticipate and meet your audience’s basic needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_p03">Aristotle outlined three main forms of rhetorical proof: ethos, logos, and pathos. Ethos involves the speaker’s character and expertise. Logos is the logic of the speaker’s presentation—something that will be greatly enhanced by a good organizational plan. Aristotle discussed pathos as the use of emotion as a persuasive element in the speech,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn12_003">Wisse, J. (1989). <em class="emphasis">Ethos and pathos: From Aristotle to Cicero</em>. Amsterdam, Netherlands: Adolph M. Hakkert.</span> or “the arousing of emotions in the audience.” We don’t always make decisions based on clear thinking. Sometimes we are moved by words, by a scene in a movie, or by other mediated forms of communication. As the speaker, you may create a message by selecting some aspects and rejecting others. A close-up picture of a child starving to death can capture attention and arouse emotions. If you use pathos in a strategic way, you are following Aristotle’s notion of rhetorical proof as the available means of persuasion. If logic and expertise don’t move the audience, a tragic picture may do so.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_p04">The cognate strategies are in many ways expressions of these three elements, but by focusing on individual characteristics, can work towards being more effective in their preparation and presentation. Many of these strategies build on basic ideas of communication, such as verbal and nonverbal delivery. By keeping that in mind, you’ll be more likely to see the connections and help yourself organize your presentation effectively.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_p05">Here we adapt and extend Kostelnick and Roberts’ strategies in order to highlight ways to approach the preparation and presentation of your message. Across the cognate strategies, we can see Aristotle’s rhetorical elements through a range of strategies to communicate better with our audience. There is a degree of overlap, and many of the strategies draw on related elements, but by examining each strategy as a technique for engaging your audience, you can better craft your message to meet their expectations.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Tone</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s01_p01">From the choice of your words, to the choice of your dress, you contribute to the tone of the speech. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Tone</a><span class="glossdef">The general manner of expression of the message.</span></span>, or the general manner of expression of the message, will contribute to the context of the presentation. First, consider your voice. Is it relaxed, or shaky and nervous? Your voice is like a musical instrument that, when played expressively, fulfills a central role in your ability to communicate your message to your audience. Next consider how your tone is expressed through your body language. Are your arms straight down at your sides, or crossed in front of you, or are they moving in a natural flow to the rhythm and cadence of your speech? Your dress, your use of space, and the degree to which you are comfortable with yourself will all play a part in the expression of your message.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Emphasis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s02_p01">If everyone speaks at the same time, it’s hard for anyone to listen. In the same way, if all your points are equally presented, it can be hard to distinguish one from another, or to focus on the points that are most important. As the speaker, you need to consider how you place emphasis—stress, importance, or prominence—on some aspects of your speech, and how you lessen the impact of others. Perhaps you have a visual aid to support your speech in the form of a visually arresting picture. Imagine that you want to present a persuasive speech on preventing skin cancer and you start with a photo of two people wearing very little clothing. While the image may capture attention, clearly placing emphasis on skin, it may prove to be more of a distraction than an addition. Emphasis as a cognate strategy asks you to consider relevance, and the degree to which your focal point of attention contributes to or detracts from your speech. You will need to consider how you link ideas through transitions, how you repeat and rephrase, and how you place your points in hierarchical order to address the strategy of emphasis in your presentation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Engagement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s03_p01">Before you start thinking about weddings, consider what key element is necessary for one to occur? If you guessed a relationship you were correct. Just as a couple forms an interpersonal relationship, the speaker forms a relationship with the audience members. Eye contact can be an engaging aspect of this strategy, and can help you form a connection—an engagement—with individual audience members. Looking at the floor or ceiling may not display interest to the audience. Engagement strategies develop the relationship with the audience, and you will need to consider how your words, visuals, and other relevant elements of your speech help this relationship grow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Clarity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s04_p01">As a speaker, you may have excellent ideas to present, but if they are not made clear to the audience, your speech will be a failure. “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Clarity</a><span class="glossdef">Strategies that help the receiver (audience) to decode the message, to understand it quickly and completely, and when necessary, to react without ambivalence.</span></span> strategies help the receiver (audience) to decode the message, to understand it quickly and completely, and when necessary, to react without ambivalence.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn12_004">Kostelnick, C., &amp; Roberts, D. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Designing visual language: Strategies for professional communicators</em> (p. 17). Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> Your word choices, how you say them, and in what order all relate to clarity. If you use euphemisms, or indirect expressions, to communicate a delicate idea, your audience may not follow you. If you use a story, or an arresting image, and fail to connect it clearly to your main point or idea, your audience will also fail to see the connection. Depending on the rhetorical situation, the use of jargon may clarify your message or confuse your audience. You’ll also need to consider the visual elements of your presentation and how they clarify your information. Is the font sufficiently large on your PowerPoint slide to be read in the back of the room? Is your slide so packed with words that they key ideas are lost in a noise of text? Will it be clear to your listeners how your pictures, motion clips, or audio files relate to topic?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s07_p01">Here we can clearly see Aristotle’s ethos—character and expertise. You will naturally develop a relationship with your audience, and the need to make trust an element is key to that development. The word “credibility” comes from the word “credence,” or belief. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Credibility</a><span class="glossdef">Qualities, capabilities, or power to elicit from the audience belief in one’s character.</span></span> involves your qualities, capabilities, or power to elicit from the audience belief in your character. Cultivating a sense of your character and credibility may involve displaying your sense of humor, your ability to laugh at yourself, your academic or profession-specific credentials, or your personal insight into the topic you are discussing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s07_p02">For example, if you are going to present a persuasive speech on the dangers of drinking and driving, and start with a short story about how you helped implement a “designated driver” program, the audience will understand your relationship to the message, and form a positive perception of your credibility. If you are going to persuade the audience to give blood, practice safe sex, or get an HIV test, your credibility on the subject may come from your studies in the medical or public health field, from having volunteered at a blood drive, or perhaps from having had a loved one who needed a blood transfusion. Consider persuasive strategies that will appeal to your audience, build trust, and convey your understanding of the rhetorical situation.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Expectation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s08_p01">Your audience, as we’ve addressed previously, will have inherent expectations of themselves and of you depending on the rhetorical situation. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Expectations</a><span class="glossdef">Anticipation of the norms, roles and outcomes of the speaker and the speech.</span></span> involve the often unstated, eager anticipation of the norms, roles and outcomes of the speaker and the speech. If you are giving an after-dinner speech at a meeting where the audience members will have had plenty to eat and drink immediately before you get up to speak, you know that your audience’s attention may be influenced by their state of mind. The “after-dinner speech” often incorporates humor for this very reason, and the anticipation that you will be positive, lighthearted and funny is implicit in the rhetorical situation. If, on the other hand, you are going to address a high school assembly on the importance of graduating from high school and pursuing a college education, you may also be motivational, funny, and lighthearted, but there will be an expectation that you will also discuss some serious issues as a part of your speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s09">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reference</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s09_p01">No one person knows everything all the time at any given moment, and no two people have experienced life in the same way. For this reason, use references carefully. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Reference</a><span class="glossdef">Attention to the source and way you present your information.</span></span> involves attention to the source and way you present your information. If you are a licensed pilot and want to inform your audience about the mistaken belief that flying is more dangerous than driving, your credibility will play a role. You might also say “according to the Federal Aviation Administration” as you cite mortality statistics associated with aviation accidents in a given year. The audience won’t expect you to personally gather statistics and publish a study, but they will expect you to state where you got your information. If you are talking to a group of children who have never flown before, and lack a frame of reference to the experience of flying, you will need to consider how to reference key ideas within their scope of experience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s02_s09_p02">A good way to visualize this is as a frame, where some information you display to the audience is within the frame, and other information (that you do not display) lies outside the frame. You focus the information to improve clarity and conciseness, and the audience will want to know why the information you chose is included and where you got it. That same frame may also be related to experience, and your choice of terms, order or reliance on visual aids to communicate ideas. If you are giving a speech on harvesting crops on an incline, and your audience is made up of rural Bolivians who farm manually, talking about a combine may not be as effective as showing one in action in order to establish a frame of reference.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s03_p01">As you begin to investigate your topic, make sure you consider several sides of an issue. Let’s say you are going to do a speech to inform on the history of the First Transcontinental Railroad. At first you may have looked at just two sides, railroaders versus local merchants. Railroad tycoons wanted to bring the country together—moving people, goods, and services in a more efficient way—and to make money. Local merchants wanted to keep out competition and retain control of their individual markets.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s03_p02">Take another look at this issue and you see that several other perspectives have bearing on this issue. Shipping was done primarily by boat prior to the railroad, so shippers would not want the competition. Recent Chinese immigrants were in need of work. Native Americans did not want to lose their culture or way of life, and a railroad that crossed the country would cut right through the buffalo’s migration patterns. We now have five perspectives to the central issue, which makes the topic all the more interesting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s03_p03">The general purpose is to inform the audience on the First Transcontinental Railroad and its impact on a young but developing United States. The thesis statement focuses on shipping, communication, and cultures across America.</p>

        <li>Change in shipping</li>
        <li>Change in communication</li>

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s03_p05">Think of each one of these main points as a separate but shorter speech. The point is to develop each of these main points like you have developed your overall speech. What do you want to focus on? The major types of shipping at the time of the First Transcontinental Railroad? One aspect you may want consider is to what degree is your audience familiar with this time in history. If they are not very familiar, a little background and context can help make your speech more meaningful and enhance its relevance to your thesis statement. By taking time to consider what you want to accomplish with each point, you will help yourself begin to address how you need to approach each point. Once you have thought about what you want to focus on for each point, list each subheading next to the main points. For example,</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s03_p06">By now you’ve identified your key points and are ready to start planning your speech in more detail. While your organizational structure will vary from speech to speech, there are nonetheless five main parts of any speech: attention statement, introduction, body, conclusion, and residual message. These are basic to the rhetorical process and you will see time and time again, regardless of audience or culture, these same elements in some form utilized to communicate in public. They will serve to guide you, and possibly even save you should you get a last minute request to do a speech or presentation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s03_p07">Place your hand on the table or desk and you’ll more likely see a thumb and four fingers. Associate your hand with these five elements. Each digit is independently quite weak, but together they make a powerful fist. Your thumb is quite versatile and your most important digit. It’s a lot like your attention statement. If you don’t gain the audience’s attention, the rest of the speech will be ineffective.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch12_s03_p08">Each successive digit can represent the remaining four parts of any speech. One day you will be asked to speak with little or no time for preparation. By focusing on this organizational model, and looking down at your hand, you can quickly and accurately prepare your speech. With the luxury of time for preparation, each step can even be further developed. Remember the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">five-finger model of public speaking</a><span class="glossdef">Consists of the attention statement, introduction, body, conclusion, residual message.</span></span>, as summarized in <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch12_s03_t01">Table 12.3 "Five-Finger Model of Public Speaking"</a>, and you will always stand out as a more effective speaker.</p>

If you were going to build a house, you would need a strong foundation. Could the columns and beams hold your roof in place without anything to keep them from falling down? Of course not. In the same way, the columns or beams are like the main ideas of your speech, and identifying them is one important step. Another is to consider how to position them securely to rest on a solid foundation, have sufficient connection to each other that they become interdependent, and to make sure they stay where you want them to so your house, or your speech, doesn’t come crashing down.</p>

They are often described as bridges between ideas, thought or concepts, providing some sense of where you’ve been and where you are going with your speech. Transitions are used by the speaker to guide the audience in the progression from one significant idea, concept or point to the next issue. They can also show the relationship between the main point and the support the speaker uses to illustrate, provide examples for, or reference outside sources. Depending your purpose, transitions can serve different roles as you help create the glue that will connect your points together in a way the audience can easily follow.</p>
