        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch13_s05_l01">
            <li>Discuss and provide examples of ways to incorporate ethics in a speech.</li>
            <li>Construct an effective speech to inform.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_p01">Now that we’ve covered issues central to the success of your informative speech, there’s no doubt you want to get down to work. Here are five final suggestions to help you succeed.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Start with What You Know</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s01_p01">Are you taking other classes right now that are fresh in your memory? Are you working on a challenging chemistry problem that might lend itself to your informative speech? Are you reading a novel by Gabriel García Márquez that might inspire you to present a biographical speech, informing your audience about the author? Perhaps you have a hobby or outside interest that you are excited about that would serve well. Regardless of where you draw the inspiration, it’s a good strategy to start with what you know and work from there. You’ll be more enthusiastic, helping your audience to listen intently, and you’ll save yourself time. Consider the audience’s needs, not just your need to cross a speech off your “to-do” list. This speech will be an opportunity for you to take prepared material and present it, gaining experience and important feedback. In the “real world,” you often lack time and the consequences of a less than effective speech can be serious. Look forward to the opportunity and use what you know to perform an effective, engaging speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Consider Your Audience’s Prior Knowledge</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s02_p01">You don’t want to present a speech on the harmful effects of smoking when no one in the audience smokes. You may be more effective addressing the issue of secondhand smoke, underscoring the relationship to relevance and addressing the issue of importance with your audience. The audience will want to learn something from you, not hear everything they have heard before. It’s a challenge to assess what they’ve heard before, and often a class activity is conducted to allow audience members to come to know each other. You can also use their speeches and topic selection as points to consider. Think about age, gender, and socioeconomic status, as well as your listeners’ culture or language. Survey the audience if possible, or ask a couple of classmates what they think of the topics you are considering.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s02_p02">In the same way, when you prepare a speech in a business situation, do your homework. Access the company Web site, visit the location and get to know people, and even call members of the company to discuss your topic. The more information you can gather about your audience, the better you will be able to adapt and present an effective speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Adapting Jargon and Technical Terms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s03_p01">You may have a topic in mind from another class or an outside activity, but chances are that there are terms specific to the area or activity. From wakeboarding to rugby to a chemical process that contributes to global warming, there will be jargon and technical terms. Define and describe the key terms for your audience as part of your speech and substitute common terms where appropriate. Your audience will enjoy learning more about the topic and appreciate your consideration as you present your speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Outside Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s04_p01">Even if you think you know everything there is to know about your topic, using outside sources will contribute depth to your speech, provide support for your main points, and even enhance your credibility as a speaker. “According to ____________” is a normal way of attributing information to a source, and you should give credit where credit is due. There is nothing wrong with using outside information as long as you clearly cite your sources and do not present someone else’s information as your own.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting Information Ethically</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_p01">A central but often unspoken expectation of the speaker is that we will be ethical. This means, fundamentally, that we perceive one another as human beings with common interests and needs, and that we attend to the needs of others as well as our own. An ethical informative speaker expresses respect for listeners by avoiding prejudiced comments against any group, and by being honest about the information presented, including information that may contradict the speaker’s personal biases. The ethical speaker also admits it when he or she does not know something. The best salespersons recognize that ethical communication is the key to success, as it builds a healthy relationship where the customer’s needs are met, thereby meeting the salesperson’s own needs.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reciprocity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s01_p01">Tyler<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn13_011">Tyler, V. (1978). Report of the working groups of the second SCA summer conference on intercultural communication. In N. C. Asuncio-Lande (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Ethical Perspectives and Critical Issues in Intercultural Communication</em> (pp. 170–177). Falls Church, VA: SCA.</span> discusses ethical communication and specifically indicates reciprocity as a key principle. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Reciprocity</a><span class="glossdef">The mutual expectation for exchange of value or service.</span></span>, or a relationship of mutual exchange and interdependence, is an important characteristic of a relationship, particularly between a speaker and the audience. We’ve examined previously the transactional nature of communication, and it is important to reinforce this aspect here. We exchange meaning with one another in conversation, and much like a game, it takes more than one person to play. This leads to interdependence, or the dependence of the conversational partners on one another. Inequality in the levels of dependence can negatively impact the communication and, as a result, the relationship. You as the speaker will have certain expectations and roles, but dominating your audience will not encourage them to fulfill their roles in terms of participation and active listening. Communication involves give and take, and in a public speaking setting, where the communication may be perceived as “all to one,” don’t forget that the audience is also communicating in terms of feedback with you. You have a responsibility to attend to that feedback, and develop reciprocity with your audience. Without them, you don’t have a speech.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Mutuality</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Mutuality</a><span class="glossdef">Searching for common ground and understanding with the audience.</span></span> means that you search for common ground and understanding with the audience, establishing this space and building on it throughout the speech. This involves examining viewpoints other than your own, and taking steps to insure the speech integrates an inclusive, accessible format rather than an ethnocentric one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Nonjudgmentalism</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nonjudgmentalism</a><span class="glossdef">Being open-minded; willing to examine diverse perspectives.</span></span> underlines the need to be open-minded, an expression of one’s willingness to examine diverse perspectives. Your audience expects you to state the truth as you perceive it, with supporting and clarifying information to support your position, and to speak honestly. They also expect you to be open to their point of view and be able to negotiate meaning and understanding in a constructive way. Nonjudgmentalism may include taking the perspective that being different is not inherently bad and that there is common ground to be found with each other.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s03_p02">While this characteristic should be understood, we can see evidence of breakdowns in communication when audiences perceive they are not being told the whole truth. This does not mean that the relationship with the audience requires honesty and excessive self-disclosure. The use of euphemisms and displays of sensitivity are key components of effective communication, and your emphasis on the content of your speech and not yourself will be appreciated. Nonjudgmentalism does underscore the importance of approaching communication from an honest perspective where you value and respect your audience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Honesty</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Honesty</a><span class="glossdef">Truthfulness; a key ingredient in trust.</span></span>, or truthfulness, directly relates to trust, a cornerstone in the foundation of a relationship with your audience. Without it, the building (the relationship) would fall down. Without trust, a relationship will not open and develop the possibility of mutual understanding. You want to share information and the audience hopefully wants to learn from you. If you “cherry-pick” your data, only choosing the best information to support only your point and ignore contrary or related issues, you may turn your informative speech into a persuasive one with bias as a central feature.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s04_p02">Look at the debate over the U.S. conflict with Iraq. There has been considerable discussion concerning the cherry-picking of issues and facts to create a case for armed intervention. To what degree the information at the time was accurate or inaccurate will continue to be a hotly debated issue, but the example holds in terms on an audience’s response to a perceived dishonestly. Partial truths are incomplete and often misleading, and you don’t want your audience to turn against you because they suspect you are being less than forthright and honest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Respect</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s05_p01">Respect should be present throughout a speech, demonstrating the speaker’s high esteem for the audience. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Respect</a><span class="glossdef">Giving and displaying particular attention to the value you associate with someone or a group.</span></span> can be defined as an act of giving and displaying particular attention to the value you associate with someone or a group. This definition involves two key components. You need to give respect in order to earn from others, and you need to show it. Displays of respect include making time for conversation, not interrupting, and even giving appropriate eye contact during conversations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Trust</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s06_p01">Communication involves sharing and that requires trust. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Trust</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to rely on the character or truth of someone.</span></span> means the ability to rely on the character or truth of someone, that what you say you mean and your audience knows it. Trust is a process, not a thing. It builds over time, through increased interaction and the reduction of uncertainty. It can be lost, but it can also be regained. It should be noted that it takes a long time to build trust in a relationship and can be lost in a much shorter amount of time. If your audience suspects you mislead them this time, how will they approach your next presentation? Acknowledging trust and its importance in your relationship with the audience is the first step in focusing on this key characteristic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s07">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Avoid Exploitation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s07_p01">Finally, when we speak ethically, we do not intentionally exploit one another. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Exploitation</a><span class="glossdef">Taking advantage of someone or something; using someone else for one’s own purposes.</span></span> means taking advantage, using someone else for one’s own purposes. Perceiving a relationship with an audience as a means to an end and only focusing on what you get out of it, will lead you to treat people as objects. The temptation to exploit others can be great in business situations, where a promotion, a bonus, or even one’s livelihood are at stake.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s07_p02">Suppose you are a bank loan officer. Whenever a customer contacts the bank to inquire about applying for a loan, your job is to provide an informative presentation about the types of loans available, their rates and terms. If you are paid a commission based on the number of loans you make and their amounts and rates, wouldn’t you be tempted to encourage them to borrow the maximum amount they can qualify for? Or perhaps to take a loan with confusing terms that will end up costing much more in fees and interest than the customer realizes? After all, these practices are within the law; aren’t they just part of the way business is done? If you are an ethical loan officer, you realize you would be exploiting customers if you treated them this way. You know it is more valuable to uphold your long-term relationships with customers than to exploit them so that you can earn a bigger commission.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch13_s05_s05_s07_p03">Consider these ethical principles when preparing and presenting your speech, and you will help address many of these natural expectations of others and develop healthier, more effective speeches.</p>
