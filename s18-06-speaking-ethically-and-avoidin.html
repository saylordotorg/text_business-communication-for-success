    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_p01">What comes to mind when you think of speaking to persuade? Perhaps the idea of persuasion may bring to mind propaganda and issues of manipulation, deception, intentional bias, bribery, and even coercion. Each element relates to persuasion, but in distinct ways. In a democratic society, we would hope that our Bill of Rights is intact and validated, and that we would support the exercise of freedom to discuss, consider and debate issues when considering change. We can recognize that each of these elements in some ways has a negative connotation associated with it. Why do you think that deceiving your audience, bribing a judge, or coercing people to do something against their wishes is wrong? These tactics violate our sense of fairness, freedom, and ethics.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_p02">Manipulation involves the management of facts, ideas or points of view to play upon inherent insecurities or emotional appeals to one’s own advantage. Your audience expects you to treat them with respect, and deliberately manipulating them by means of fear, guilt, duty, or a relationship is unethical. In the same way, deception involves the use of lies, partial truths, or the omission of relevant information to deceive your audience. No one likes to be lied to, or made to believe something that is not true. Deception can involve intentional bias, or the selection of information to support your position while framing negatively any information that might challenge your belief.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_p03">Bribery involves the giving of something in return for an expected favor, consideration, or privilege. It circumvents the normal protocol for personal gain, and again is a strategy that misleads your audience. Coercion is the use of power to compel action. You make someone do something they would not choose to do freely. You might threaten punishment, and people may go along with you while the “stick” is present, but once the threat is removed, they will revert to their previous position, often with new antagonism toward the person or agency that coerced them. While you may raise the issue that the ends justify the means, and you are “doing it for the audience’s own good,” recognize the unethical nature of coercion.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_p04">As Martin Luther King Jr. stated in his advocacy of nonviolent resistance, two wrongs do not make a right. They are just two wrongs and violate the ethics that contribute to community and healthy relationships. Each issue certainly relates to persuasion, but you as the speaker should be aware of each in order to present an ethical persuasive speech. Learn to recognize when others try to use these tactics on you, and know that your audience will be watching to see if you try any of these strategies on them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Eleven Points for Speaking Ethically</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_s01_p01">In his book <em class="emphasis">Ethics in Human Communication</em>,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn14_024">Johannesen, R. (1996). <em class="emphasis">Ethics in human communication</em> (4th ed.). Prospect Heights, IL: Waveland Press.</span> Richard Johannesen offers eleven points to consider when speaking to persuade. His main points reiterate many of the points across this chapter and should be kept in mind as you prepare, and present, your persuasive message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_s01_p02">Do not:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>use false, fabricated, misrepresented, distorted or irrelevant evidence to support arguments or claims.</li>
            <li>intentionally use unsupported, misleading, or illogical reasoning.</li>
            <li>represent yourself as informed or an “expert” on a subject when you are not.</li>
            <li>use irrelevant appeals to divert attention from the issue at hand.</li>
            <li>ask your audience to link your idea or proposal to emotion-laden values, motives, or goals to which it is actually not related.</li>
            <li>deceive your audience by concealing your real purpose, by concealing self-interest, by concealing the group you represent, or by concealing your position as an advocate of a viewpoint.</li>
            <li>distort, hide, or misrepresent the number, scope, intensity, or undesirable features of consequences or effects.</li>
            <li>use “emotional appeals” that lack a supporting basis of evidence or reasoning.</li>
            <li>oversimplify complex, gradation-laden situations into simplistic, two-valued, either-or, polar views or choices.</li>
            <li>pretend certainty where tentativeness and degrees of probability would be more accurate.</li>
            <li>advocate something which you yourself do not believe in.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_s01_p03">Aristotle said the mark of a good person, well spoken was a clear command of the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion. He discussed the idea of perceiving the many points of view related to a topic, and their thoughtful consideration. While it’s important to be able to perceive the complexity of a case, you are not asked to be a lawyer defending a client.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_s01_p04">In your speech to persuade, consider honesty and integrity as you assemble your arguments. Your audience will appreciate your thoughtful consideration of more than one view, your understanding of the complexity, and you will build your ethos, or credibility, as you present your document. Be careful not to stretch the facts, or assemble them only to prove yourself, and instead prove the argument on its own merits. Deception, coercion, intentional bias, manipulation and bribery should have no place in your speech to persuade.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Avoiding Fallacies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s06_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Fallacies</a><span class="glossdef">False logic.</span></span> are another way of saying false logic. These rhetorical tricks deceive your audience with their style, drama, or pattern, but add little to your speech in terms of substance and can actually detract from your effectiveness. There are several techniques or “tricks” that allow the speaker to rely on style without offering substantive argument, to obscure the central message, or twist the facts to their own gain. Here we will examine the eight classical fallacies. You may note that some of them relate to the ethical cautions listed earlier in this section. Eight common fallacies are presented in <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch14_s06_s02_t01">Table 14.5 "Fallacies"</a>. Learn to recognize these fallacies so they can’t be used against you, and so that you can avoid using them with your audience.</p>
