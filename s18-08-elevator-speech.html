    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s08_p01">An elevator speech is to oral communication what a Twitter message (limited to 140 characters) is to written communication. It has to engage and interest the listener, inform and/or persuade, and be memorable.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn14_025">Howell, L.

Bothell, WA: Publishers Network.</span> An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">elevator speech</a><span class="glossdef">A presentation that persuades the listener in less than thirty seconds.</span></span> is a presentation that persuades the listener in less than thirty seconds, or around a hundred words. It takes its name from the idea that in a short elevator ride (of perhaps ten floors), carefully chosen words can make a difference. In addition to actual conversations taking place during elevator rides, other common examples include the following:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating an Elevator Speech</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch14_s08_s01_p01">An elevator speech does not have to be a formal event, though it can be. An elevator speech is not a full sales pitch and should not get bloated with too much information. The idea is not to rattle off as much information as possible in a short time, nor to present a “canned” thirty-second advertising message, but rather to give a relaxed and genuine “nutshell” summary of one main idea. The speech can be generic and nonspecific to the audience or listener, but the more you know about your audience, the better. When you tailor your message to that audience, you zero in on your target and increase your effectiveness.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn14_026">Albertson, E. (2008). <em class="emphasis">How to open doors with a brilliant elevator speech</em>. New Providence, NJ: R. R.
