        <h2 class="title editable block">Common Elements of Effective Sound Bites</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch15_s01_s01_p01">Whether you are writing a document, preparing a presentation, or both, you will want to consider how others will summarize your main point. If you can provide a clear sound bite or quote, it is more likely to get picked up and repeated, reinforcing your message. By preparing your sound bites, you help control the interpretation of your message.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn15_004">Kerchner, K. (1997). <em class="emphasis">Soundbites: A business guide for working with the media</em>. Superior, WI: Savage Press.</span> Here are four characteristics of effective sound bites:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch15_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Clear and concise</li>
            <li>Use vivid, dynamic language</li>
            <li>Easy to repeat</li>
            <li>Memorable</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch15_s01_s01_p02">Your goal when writing a sound bite or quote is to make sure your idea represents all four characteristics. You won’t always be creating the message; in some cases you may be asked to summarize someone else’s written or verbal message, such as an interview, with a quote or a sound bite. Look for one or more sentences or phrases that capture these elements and test them out on your classmates or colleagues. Can the sound bite, slogan, or quote be delivered without stumbling? Is it easy to read? Does it get the job done?</p>
