        <h2 class="title editable block">Strategies for Effective Meetings</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch15_s03_s01_p01">You want an efficient and effective meeting, but recognize that group communication by definition can be chaotic and unpredictable. To stay on track, consider the following strategies:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch15_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Send out the last meeting’s minutes one week before the next meeting.</li>
            <li>Send out the agenda for the current meeting at least one week in advance.</li>
            <li>Send out reminders for the meeting the day before and the day of the meeting.</li>
            <li>Schedule the meeting in Outlook or a similar program so everyone receives a reminder.</li>
            <li>Start and end your meetings on time.</li>
            <li>Make sure the participants know their role and requirements prior to the meeting.</li>
            <li>Make sure all participants know one another before discussion starts.</li>
            <li>Formal communication styles and reference to the agenda can help reinforce the time frame and tasks.</li>
            <li>Follow Robert’s Rules of Order when applicable, or at least be familiar with them.</li>
            <li>Make sure notes taken at the meeting are legible and can be converted to minutes for distribution later.</li>
            <li>Keep the discussion on track, and if you are the chair, or leader of a meeting, don’t hesitate to restate a point to interject and redirect the attention back to the next agenda point.</li>
            <li>If you are the chair, draw a clear distinction between on-topic discussions and those that are more personal, individual, or off topic.</li>
            <li>Communicate your respect and appreciation for everyone’s time and effort.</li>
            <li>Clearly communicate the time, date, and location or means of contact for the next meeting.</li>

                <li>Create a sample agenda for a business meeting to discuss the quarterly sales report and results from the latest marketing campaign.

Note in your agenda all the elements listed above, even if some elements (such as “good of the order”) only serve as a placeholder for the discussion that will take place.</li>
                <li>Write a brief description of a meeting you recently attended and indicate one way you perceived it as being effective. Compare with classmates.</li>
