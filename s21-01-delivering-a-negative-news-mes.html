Delivering negative news is never easy. Whether you are informing someone they are being laid off or providing constructive criticism on their job performance, how you choose to deliver the message can influence its response.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn17_001">Bovee, C., &amp; Thill, J. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Business communication essentials: A skills-based approach to vital business English</em> (4th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> Some people prefer their bad news to be direct and concise. Others may prefer a less direct approach. Regardless whether you determine a direct or indirect approach is warranted, your job is to deliver news that you anticipate will be unwelcome, unwanted, and possibly dismissed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p02">In this section we will examine several scenarios that can be communicated internally (within the organization) and externally (outside the organization), but recognize that the lines can be blurred as communication flows outside and through an organization or business. Internal and external communication environments often have a degree of overlap. The rumor of anticipated layoffs may surface in the local media, and you may be called upon to address the concern within the organization. In a similar way, a product that has failed internal quality control tests will require several more tests and improvements before it is ready for market, but if that information leaves the organization, it can hurt the business reputation, prospects for future contracts, and the company’s ability to secure financing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p03">Communication is constantly present, and our ability to manage, clarify, and guide understanding is key to addressing challenges while maintaining trust and integrity with employees, stakeholders, and the public.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p04">There are seven goals to keep in mind when delivering negative news, in person or in written form:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_l02">
        <li>Be clear and concise in order not to require additional clarification.</li>
        <li>Help the receiver understand and accept the news.</li>
        <li>Maintain trust and respect for the business or organization and for the receiver.</li>
        <li>Avoid legal liability or erroneous admission of guilt or culpability.</li>
        <li>Maintain the relationship, even if a formal association is being terminated.</li>
        <li>Reduce the anxiety associated with the negative news to increase comprehension.</li>
        <li>Achieve the designated business outcome.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p05">Let’s examine our first scenario:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p06">You are a supervisor and have been given the task of discussing repeated tardiness with an employee, Chris. Chris has frequently been late for work, and the problem has grown worse over the last two weeks. The tardiness is impairing not only Chris’s performance, but also that of the entire work team. Your manager has instructed you to put an end to it. The desired result is for Chris to stop his tardiness behavior and improve his performance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p07">You can</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_l03">
        <li>stop by Chris’s cubicle and simply say, “Get to work on time or you are out”;</li>
        <li>invite Chris out to a nice lunch and let him have it;</li>
        <li>write Chris a stern e-mail;</li>
        <li>ask Chris to come to your office and discuss the behavior with him in private.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p08">While there are many other ways you could choose to address the situation, let’s examine each of these four alternatives in light of the goals to keep in mind when presenting negative news.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p09">First, you could approach Chris in his work space and speak to him directly. Advantages include the ability to get right to the point right away. Disadvantages include the strain on the supervisor-employee relationship as a result of the public display of criticism, the possibility that Chris may not understand you, the lack of a formal discussion you can document, and the risk that your actions may not bring about the desired results.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p10">The goals include the desire to be clear and concise in order not to require additional clarification. This possible response does not provide the opportunity for discussion, feedback, or confirmation that Chris has clearly understood your concern. It fails to address the performance concern, and limits the correction to the tardiness. It fails to demonstrate respect for all parties. The lack of tact apparent in the approach may reflect negatively on you as the supervisor, not only with Chris but with your manager as well.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p11">When you need to speak to an employee about a personnel concern, it is always best to do it in private. Give thought and concern to the conversation before it occurs, and make a list of points to cover with specific information, including grievances. Like any other speech, you may need to rehearse, particularly if this type of meeting is new to you. When it comes time to have the discussion, issue the warning, back it up in writing with documentation, and don’t give the impression that you might change your decision. Whether the issue at hand is a simple caution about tardiness or a more serious conversation, you need to be fair and respectful, even if the other person has been less than professional. Let’s examine the next alternative.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p12">Let’s say you invite Chris to lunch at a nice restaurant. There is linen on the table, silverware is present for more than the main course, and the water glasses have stems. The environment says “good job” in its uniqueness, presentation, and luxury. Your word will contradict this nonverbal message. The juxtaposition between the environment and the verbal message will cause tension and confusion, which will probably be an obstacle to the receiver’s ability to listen. If Chris doesn’t understand the message, and the message requires clarification, your approach has failed. The contrast between the restaurant setting and the negative message does not promote understanding and acceptance of the bad news or correction. Furthermore, it does not build trust in the relationship, as the restaurant invitation might be interpreted as a “trap” or a betrayal. Let’s examine yet another approach.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p13">You’ve written Chris a stern e-mail. You’ve included a list of all the recent dates when he was late and made several statements about the quality of his work. You’ve indicated he needs to improve, and stop being late, or else. But was your e-mail harassment? Could it be considered beyond the scope of supervision and interpreted as mean or cruel? And do you even know if Chris has received it? If there was no reply, do you know whether it achieved its desired business outcome? A written message may certainly be part of the desired approach, but how it is presented and delivered is as important as what it says. Let’s examine our fourth approach to this scenario.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p14">You ask Chris to join you in a private conversation. You start the conversation with an expression of concern and an open-ended question: “Chris, I’ve been concerned about your work lately. Is everything all right?” As Chris answers, you may demonstrate that you are listening by nodding your head, and possibly taking notes. You may learn that Chris has been having problems sleeping, or that his living situation has changed. Or Chris may decline to share any issues, deny that anything is wrong, and ask why you are concerned. You may then state that you’ve observed the chronic tardiness, and name one or more specific mistakes you have found in Chris’s work, ending with a reiteration that you are concerned. This statement of concern may elicit more responses and open the conversation up into a dialogue where you come to understand the situation, Chris sees your concern, and the relationship is preserved. Alternatively, in case the conversation does not go well, you will still keep a positive attitude even as you document the meeting and give Chris a verbal warning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p15">Regardless of how well or poorly the conversation goes, if Chris tells other employees about it, they will take note of how you handled the situation, and it will contribute to their perception of you. It guides their expectations of how you operate and how to communicate with you, as this interaction is not only about you and Chris. You represent the company and its reputation, and your professional display of concern as you try to learn more sends a positive message. While the private, respectful meeting may not be the perfect solution, it is preferable to the other approaches we have considered.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p16">One additional point to consider as you document this interaction is the need to present the warning in writing. You may elect to prepare a memo that outlines the information concerning Chris’s performance and tardiness and have it ready should you want to present it. If the session goes well, and you have the discretion to make a judgment call, you may elect to give him another week to resolve the issue. Even if it goes well, you may want to present the memo, as it documents the interaction and serves as evidence of due process should Chris’s behavior fail to change, eventually resulting in the need for termination.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p17">This combined approach of a verbal and written message is increasingly the norm in business communication. In the next two sections, we’ll compare and contrast approaches, verbal and written, and outline several best practices in terms of approach. But first, we’ll outline the four main parts of a negative news message:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_l04">
        <li>Buffer or cushion</li>
        <li>Explanation</li>
        <li>Negative news</li>
        <li>Redirect</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p18">The first part of a negative news message, verbal or written, involves neutral or positive information. This sets the tone and often serves as a buffer or cushion for the information to come. Next, an explanation discusses why there is an issue in the first place. This may be relatively simple, quite complex, or uncomfortable. In a journal article titled “Further Conceptualization of Explanations in Negative News Messages,”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn17_002">Limaye, Mohan R. (1997, June 1). Further conceptualization of explanation in negative messages. <em class="emphasis">Business Communication Quarterly, 60</em>(2), 38–50.</span> Mohan Limaye makes the clear case that not only is an explanation a necessary part of any negative news message, it is an ethical and moral requirement. While an explanation is important, never admit or imply responsibility without written authorization from your company cleared by legal counsel. The third part of the negative news message involves the bad news itself, and the emphasis here is on clarity and accuracy. Finally, the redirect may refocus attention on a solution strategy, an alternative, or the subsequent actions that will take place. <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch17_s01_t01">Table 17.1 "Negative News Message Sample Script"</a> provides an example that might apply in an external communication situation.</p>

Whether you are delivering negative news in person or in writing, the four main parts of a negative message can help you meet all seven goals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p20">Before we move to the verbal and written delivery of the negative news message, we need to offer a word of counsel. You want to avoid legal problems when communicating bad news. You cannot always predict how others are going to respond, but you can prepare for and deliver your response in ways that lower the risk of litigation in four ways:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_l05">
        <li>Avoid abusive language or behavior.</li>
        <li>Avoid contradictions and absolutes.</li>
        <li>Avoid confusion or misinterpretation.</li>
        <li>Maintain respect and privacy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p21">Sarcasm, profanity, shouting, or abusive or derogatory language is an obstacle to clear communication. Furthermore, such language can be interpreted as defamatory, or harming the reputation of the person, possibly having a negative impact on their future earnings. In written form, it is called libel. If you say it out loud, it is called slander. While slander may be harder to prove, no defamatory remarks should be part of your negative news message. Cell phones increasingly serve to record conversations, and you simply never know if your words will come back to you in short order. Represent yourself, the business, and the receiver of your message with professionalism and avoid abusive or defamatory language.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p22">You also want to avoid contradictions, as they only serve to invite debate. Make sure your information is consistent and in agreement with the general information in the conversation. If one part of the information stands out as a contradiction, its importance will be magnified in the context and distract from your main message. Don’t provide more information that is necessary. Polarizing, absolute terms like “always” and “never” are often part of sweeping generalizations that are open to debate. Instead of saying, “You are always late,” choose to say, “You were late sixteen times in May.” To avoid confusion or misinterpretation, be precise and specific.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_p23">Always maintain respect and privacy. Making a negative statement about an employee in front of a group of coworkers can be considered ridicule or harm, and in the coming cases may be actionable and involve legal ramifications. In addition to the legal responsibility, you have the overall goal of demonstrating professionalism as you represent yourself and your company in maintaining the relationship with the employee, even if the end goal is termination. Employees have retaliated against their organizations in many ways, from discouraging remarks to vandalism and computer viruses. Your goal is to avoid such behavior, not out of fear, but out of professionalism and respect for yourself and your organization. Open lines of communication present in a relationship can help reduce the risk of relational deterioration or animosity. The sidebar below provides a checklist for delivering a negative message.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting Negative News in Person</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p01">Most of us dislike conflict. It may be tempting to avoid face-to-face interaction for fear of confrontation, but delivering negative news in person can be quite effective, even necessary, in many business situations. When considering a one-on-one meeting or a large, formal meeting, consider the preparation and implementation of the discussion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p02">The first step involves a clear goal. Stephen Covey (1989) recommends beginning with the end in mind.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn17_003">Covey, S. (1989). <em class="emphasis">The seven habits of highly effective people</em>. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster.</span> Do you want your negative news to inform, or to bring about change, and if so what kind of change and to what degree? A clear conceptualization of the goal allows you to anticipate the possible responses, to plan ahead, and to get your emotional “house” in order.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p03">Your emotional response to the news and the audience, whether it is one person or the whole company, will set the tone for the entire interaction. You may feel frustrated, angry, or hurt, but the display of these emotions is often more likely to make the problem worse than to help solve it. Emotions can be contagious, and people will respond to the emotional tone of the speaker.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p04">If your response involves only one other person, a private, personal meeting is the best option, but it may not be available. Increasingly people work and contribute to projects from a distance, via the Internet, and may only know each other via e-mail, phone, or videophone/videoconferencing services. A personal meeting may be impractical or impossible. How then does one deliver negative news in person? By the best option available to both parties. Written feedback may be an option via e-mail, but it takes time to prepare, send, receive, process, and respond—and the written word has its disadvantages. Miscommunication and misinterpretation can easily occur, with little opportunity for constructive feedback to check meanings and clarify perceptions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p05">The telephone call allows both parties to hear each other’s voices, including the words, the inflection, the disfluencies, and the emotional elements of conversation. It is immediate in that the possibility of overlap is present, meaning not only is proximity in terms of voice as close as possible, but both parties may experience overlaps as they take turns and communicate. Telephone calls allow for quick feedback and clarification questions, and allow both parties an opportunity to recycle and revisit topics for elaboration or a better understanding. They also can cover long distances with reasonable clarity. Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) allows you to do the same with relatively little cost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p06">While there are distinct advantages, the telephone lacks part of the nonverbal spectrum available to speakers in a live setting. On the telephone, proximity is a function of response time rather than physical space and the degree to which one person is near another. Time is also synchronous, though the telephone crosses time zones and changes the context as one party may have just arrived at work while the other party is leaving for lunch. Body language gets lost in the exchange as well, although many of us continue to make hand gestures on the phone, even when our conversational partners cannot see us. Paralanguage, or the sounds we hear that are not verbal, including pitch, tone, rate, rhythm, pace, articulation, and pronunciation are all available to the listener. As we can see, the telephone call allows for a richer communication experience than written communication, but cannot convey as much information as would be available in person. Just as a telephone interview may be used for screening purposes while a live interview is reserved for the final candidates, the live setting is often considered the best option for delivering negative news.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p07">Live and in person may be the best option for direct communication with immediate feedback. In a live setting time is constant. The participants may schedule a breakfast meeting, for example, mirroring schedules and rhythms. Live, face-to-face communication comes in many forms. The casual exchange in the hallway, the conversation over coffee, and the formal performance review meeting all have interpersonal communication in common.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s01_p08">If you need to share the message with a larger audience, you may need to speak to a group, or you might even have to make a public presentation or speech. If it needs a feedback loop, we often call it a press conference, as the speech is followed by a question and answer session. From meeting in the hallway to live, onstage, under camera lights and ready for questions, the personal delivery of negative news can be a challenging task.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting Negative News in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p01">Writing can be intrapersonal, between two people, group communication, public communication, or even mass communication. One distinct advantage of presenting negative news in writing is the planning and preparation that goes into the message, making the initial communication more predictable. When a message is delivered orally in an interpersonal setting, we may interrupt each other, we sometimes hear what we want to, and it often takes negotiation and listening skills to grasp meaning. While a written message, like all messages, is open to interpretation, the range of possibilities is narrowed and presented within the frame and format designed by the source or author.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p02">The written message involves verbal factors like language and word choice, but it can also involve nonverbal factors like timing and presentation. Do you communicate the message on letterhead, do you choose the channel of e-mail over a hard copy letter, or do you compose your written message in your best penmanship? Each choice communicates meaning, and the choice of how you present your written message influences its reception, interpretation, and the degree to which it is understood. In this section we consider the written message that delivers negative news.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p03">Let’s consider several scenarios:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>A community disaster such as illness (e.g., a swine flu epidemic), earthquake, wildfire, plane crash, or a terrorism incident</li>
            <li>An on-the-job accident with injuries or even death</li>
            <li>A product defect resulting in injuries, illness, or even death to consumers</li>
            <li>An unsuccessful product test (e.g., a new software system that isn’t going to be ready for launch as planned)</li>
            <li>A company merger that may result in reductions in force or layoffs</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p04">In business communication we often categorize our communication as internal or external. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internal communication</a><span class="glossdef">The sharing and understanding of meaning between individuals, departments, or representatives of the same business.</span></span> is the sharing and understanding of meaning between individuals, departments, or representatives of the same business. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">External communication</a><span class="glossdef">The sharing and understanding of meaning between individuals, departments, or representatives of the business and parties outside the organization.</span></span> is the sharing and understanding of meaning between individuals, departments, or representatives of the business and parties outside the organization.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p05">The confirmation of swine flu (H1N1) may first occur with a laboratory report (itself a written document), but it is normally preceded by conversations between health care professionals concerned over the symptoms exhibited by patients, including a high fever, a cough, sore throat, and a headache. According to Sally Redman, a registered nurse at Student Health Services at Washington State University–Pullman, over two thousand students (of nineteen thousand total student population) presented symptoms on or around August 21, 2009.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn17_004">Yardley, William. (2009, September 6). 2,000 Washington state students report signs of swine flu. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/health/06flu.html?_r=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/health/06flu.html?_r=1</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p06">Communication will predictably occur among students, health care professionals, and the community, but parents at a distance will want to know not only the status of their child, but also of the university. A written message that necessarily contains negative news may be written in the form of a press release, for example, noting important information like the number of students affected, the capacity of the health care system to respond, the experience to date, and whom to contact for further details and updates. This message will be read over and over as parents, reporters, and people across the country want to learn more about the situation. Like all business communication, it needs to be clear and concise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p07">Our next scenario offers a learning opportunity as well. An on-the-job accident affects employees and the company, and like our previous example, there will be considerable interest. There may be interpersonal communication between company representatives and the individual’s family, but the company will want to communicate a clear record of the occurrence with an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assurance</a><span class="glossdef">Statement that the contributing factors that gave rise to the situation has been corrected or where beyond the control of the company and its representatives.</span></span>, or statement that the contributing factors that gave rise to the situation has been corrected or were beyond the control of the company and its representatives.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p08">In addition to a statement of record, and an assurance, the company will certainly want to avoid the implication or indication of guilt or culpability. In the case of a product defect resulting in injuries, illness, or even death to consumers, this will be a relevant point of consideration. Perhaps a voluntary recall will be ordered, proactively addressing the risk before an accident occurs. It may also be the case that the recall order is issued by a government agency. Again, a written statement delivering negative news, in this case the recall of a product that presents a risk, must be written with care and consultation of legal counsel.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p09">If your company is publicly traded, the premature announcement of a software program full of bugs, or programming errors that result in less than perfect performance, can send the company’s stock price plummeting. How you release this information within the organization will influence how it is received. If your written internal memo briefly states that the software program development process has been extended to incorporate additional improvements, the emphasis shifts from the negative to the positive. While the negative news, the delay of release, remains, the focus on the benefits of the additional time can influence employees’ views, and can make a difference in how the message is received outside the organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p10">The awareness of a merger, and the possibility of a reduction in force or layoffs, will be discussed along the grapevine at work, and will give rise to tension and anticipation of negative news. You could simply write a short memo “To All Employees,” not include any contact information, and have an assistant walk around and place copies on everyone’s chair or desk during the lunch hour. But let’s look at the message this would send to employees. The written communication includes nonverbal aspects like timing and presentation as well as verbal aspects like language and word choice. The timing itself suggests avoidance of conflict, and a reluctance to address the issue with transparency. The presentation of a memo in hard copy form on your chair from an unidentified company representative will certainly cause confusion, may be mistaken for a prank, and could cause considerable stress. It will contribute to increased tensions rather than solidarity, and if trust is the foundation for all effective communication, it violates this principle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p11">Negative news may not be easy to deliver, but it is necessary at times and should be done with clarity and brevity. All parties should be clearly identified. The negative news itself should be clear and concise. The presentation should be direct, with authority and credibility. Communication occurs between people, and all humans experience concern, fear, and trepidation of the unknown. The negative news message, while it may be unwelcome, can bring light to an issue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p12">As we mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, some people prefer their bad news to be direct and concise, while others prefer a less direct approach. Let’s weigh the pros and cons of each approach. <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch17_s01_s02_t01">Table 17.2 "Direct and Indirect Delivery"</a> contrasts the elements of the two approaches.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p13">The direct approach places the negative news at the beginning of the message, while the indirect approach packages the negative news between a positive introduction, sometimes called a “buffer” or cushion, and a conclusion. Your negative message may include the rationale or reasons for the decision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p14">The direct approach is often associated with a message where the audience values brevity and the message needs to be concise. A positive introduction often introduces the topic but not the outcome. An effective negative news statement clearly states the message while limiting the possibility of misinterpretation. An effective closing statement may provide reasons, reference a policy, or indicate a procedure to follow for more information.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch17_s01_s02_p15">Delivering negative news involves a buffer or cushion statement, an explanation, the negative news itself, and a redirecting statement. Whether you choose a direct or an indirect approach, the message should be delivered clearly and concisely, with respect for the receiver and the organization.</p>
