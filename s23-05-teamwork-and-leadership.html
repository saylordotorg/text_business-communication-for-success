    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_p01">Two important aspects of group communication—especially in the business environment—are teamwork and leadership. You will work in a team and at some point may be called on to lead. You may emerge to that role as the group recognizes your specific skill set in relation to the task, or you may be appointed to a position of responsibility for yourself and others. Your communication skills will be your foundation for success as a member and as a leader. Listen and seek to understand both the task and your group members as you become involved with the new effort. Have confidence in yourself and inspire the trust of others. Know that leading and following are both integral aspects of effective teamwork.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Teamwork</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p01">Teamwork is a compound word, combining team and work. Teams are a form of group normally dedicated to production or problem solving. That leaves us with the work. This is where our previous example on problem solving can serve us well. Each member of the team has skills, talents, experience, and education. Each is expected to contribute. Work is the activity, and while it may be fun or engaging, it also requires effort and commitment, as there is a schedule for production with individual and group responsibilities. Each member must fulfill his or her own obligations for the team to succeed, and the team, like a chain, is only as strong as its weakest member. In this context we don’t measure strength or weakness at the gym, but in terms of productivity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p02">Teams can often achieve higher levels of performance than individuals because of the combined energies and talents of the members. Collaboration can produce motivation and creativity that may not be present in single-contractor projects. Individuals also have a sense of belonging to the group, and the range of views and diversity can energize the process, helping address creative blocks and stalemates. By involving members of the team in decision-making, and calling up on each member’s area of contribution, teams can produce positive results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p03">Teamwork is not without its challenges. The work itself may prove a challenge as members juggle competing assignments and personal commitments. The work may also be compromised if team members are expected to conform and pressured to go along with a procedure, plan, or product that they themselves have not developed. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Groupthink</a><span class="glossdef">Tendency to accept the group’s ideas and actions in spite of individual concerns.</span></span>, or the tendency to accept the group’s ideas and actions in spite of individual concerns, can also compromise the process and reduce efficiency. Personalities and competition can play a role in a team’s failure to produce.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p04">We can recognize that people want to belong to a successful team, and celebrating incremental gain can focus the attention on the project and its goals. Members will be more willing to express thoughts and opinions, and follow through with actions, when they perceive that they are an important part of the team. By failing to include all the team members, valuable insights may be lost in the rush to judgment or production. Making time for planning, and giving each member time to study, reflect, and contribute can allow them to gain valuable insights from each other, and may make them more likely to contribute information that challenges the status quo. Unconventional or “devil’s advocate” thinking may prove insightful and serve to challenge the process in a positive way, improving the production of the team. Respect for divergent views can encourage open discussion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p05">John Thill and Courtland Bovee<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_024">Thill, J. V., &amp; Bovee, C. L. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Essentials of business communication</em>. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> provide a valuable list to consider when setting up a team, which we have adapted here for our discussion:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Select team members wisely</li>
            <li>Select a responsible leader</li>
            <li>Promote cooperation</li>
            <li>Clarify goals</li>
            <li>Elicit commitment</li>
            <li>Clarify responsibilities</li>
            <li>Instill prompt action</li>

            <li>Ensure technological compatibility</li>
            <li>Provide prompt feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p06">Group dynamics involve the interactions and processes of a team and influence the degree to which members feel a part of the goal and mission. A team with a strong identity can prove to be a powerful force, but it requires time and commitment. A team that exerts too much control over individual members can run the risk or reducing creative interactions and encourage tunnel vision. A team that exerts too little control, with attention to process and areas of specific responsibility, may not be productive. The balance between motivation and encouragement, and control and influence, is challenging as team members represent diverse viewpoints and approaches to the problem. A skilled business communicator creates a positive team by first selecting members based on their areas of skill and expertise, but attention to their style of communication is also warranted. Individuals that typically work alone or tend to be introverted may need additional encouragement to participate. Extroverts may need to be encouraged to listen to others and not dominate the conversation. Teamwork involves teams and work, and group dynamics play an integral role in their function and production.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Leadership</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p01">Whether or not there is a “natural leader,” born with a combination of talents and traits that enable a person to lead others, has been a subject of debate across time. In a modern context, we have come to recognize that leadership comes in many form and representations. Once it was thought that someone with presence of mind, innate intelligence, and an engaging personality was destined for leadership, but modern research and experience shows us otherwise. Just as a successful heart surgeon has a series of skill sets, so does a dynamic leader. A television producer must both direct and provide space for talent to create, balancing control with confidence and trust. This awareness of various leadership styles serves our discussion as groups and teams often have leaders, and they may not always be the person who holds the title, status, or role.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p02">Leaders take on the role because they are appointed, elected, or emerge into the role. The group members play an important role in this process. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">appointed leader</a><span class="glossdef">Individual designated by an authority to serve in the leadership capacity.</span></span> is designated by an authority to serve in that capacity, irrespective of the thoughts or wishes of the group. They may serve as the leader and accomplish all the designated tasks, but if the group does not accept their role as leader, it can prove to be a challenge. As Bruce Tuckman<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_025">Tuckman, B. (1965). Developmental sequence in small groups. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 63</em>, 384–399.</span> notes, “storming” occurs as group members come to know each other and communicate more freely, and an appointed leader who lacks the endorsement of the group may experience challenges to his or her authority.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p03">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">democratic leader</a><span class="glossdef">Individual elected by a group to serve as its leader.</span></span> is elected or chosen by the group, but may also face serious challenges. If individual group members or constituent groups feel neglected or ignored, they may assert that the democratic leader does not represent their interests. The democratic leader involves the group in the decision-making process, and insures group ownership of the resulting decisions and actions as a result. Open and free discussions are representative of this process, and the democratic leader acknowledges this diversity of opinion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p04">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emergent leader</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who grows into the leadership role, often out of necessity.</span></span> contrasts the first two paths to the role by growing into the role, often out of necessity. The appointed leader may know little about the topic or content, and group members will naturally look to the senior member with the most experience for leadership. If the democratic leader fails to bring the group together, or does not represent the whole group, subgroups may form, each with an informal leader serving as spokesperson.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Leaders</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p01">We can see types of leaders in action and draw on common experience for examples. The heart surgeon does not involve everyone democratically, is typically appointed to the role through earned degrees and experience, and resembles a military sergeant more than a politician. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">autocratic leader</a><span class="glossdef">Self-directed leader who establishes norms and conduct for the group.</span></span> is self-directed and often establishes norms and conduct for the group. In some settings we can see that this is quite advantageous, such as open-heart surgery or during a military exercise, but it does not apply equally to all leadership opportunities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p02">Contrasting the autocrat is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">laissez-faire</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who practices a “live and let live” style of leadership.</span></span>, or “live and let live” leader. In a professional setting, such as a university, professors may bristle at the thought of an autocratic leader telling them what to do. They have earned their role through time, effort, and experience and know their job. A wise laissez-faire leader recognizes this aspect of working with professionals and may choose to focus efforts on providing the professors with the tools they need to make a positive impact. Imagine that you are in the role of a television director and you have a vision or idea of what the successful pilot program should look like. The script is set, the lighting correct, and the cameras are in the correct position. You may tell people what to do and where to stand, but you remember that your job is to facilitate the overall process. You work with talent, and creative people are interesting on camera. If you micromanage your actors, they may perform in ways that are not creative and that will not draw audiences. If you let them run wild through improvisation, the program may not go well at all. Balancing the need for control with the need for space is the challenge of the laissez-faire leader.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p03">Not all leaders are autocrats or laissez-faire leaders. Thomas Harris and John Sherblom<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_026">Harris, T., &amp; Sherblom, J. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Small group and team communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> specifically note three leadership styles that characterize the modern business or organization, and reflect our modern economy. We are not born leaders but may become them if the context or environment requires our skill set. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leader-as-technician</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when the leader has skills that others do not.</span></span> role often occurs when we have skills that others do not. If you can fix the copy machine at the office, your leadership and ability to get it running again are prized and sought-after skills. You may instruct others on how to load the paper or how to change the toner, and even though your pay grade may not reflect this leadership role, you are looked to by the group as a leader within that context. Technical skills, from Internet technology to facilities maintenance, may experience moments where their particular area of knowledge is required to solve a problem. Their leadership will be in demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p04">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leader-as-conductor</a><span class="glossdef">Central role of bringing people together for a common goal.</span></span> involves a central role of bringing people together for a common goal. In the common analogy, a conductor leads an orchestra and integrates the specialized skills and sounds of the various components the musical group comprises. In the same way, a leader who conducts may set a vision, create benchmarks, and collaborate with a group as they interpret a set script. Whether it is a beautiful movement in music or a group of teams that comes together to address a common challenge, the leader-as-conductor keeps the time and tempo of the group.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p05">Coaches are often discussed in business-related books as models of leadership for good reason. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leader-as-coach</a><span class="glossdef">Individual serving as a teacher, motivator, and keeper of the goals of the group.</span></span> combines many of the talents and skills we’ve discussed here, serving as a teacher, motivator, and keeper of the goals of the group. A coach may be autocratic at times, give pointed direction without input from the group, and stand on the sidelines while the players do what they’ve been trained to do and make the points. The coach may look out for the group and defend it against bad calls, and may motivate players with words of encouragement. We can recognize some of the behaviors of coaches, but what specific traits have a positive influence on the group? Thomas Peters and Nancy Austin<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_027">Peters, T., &amp; Austin, N. (1985). <em class="emphasis">A passion for excellence: The leadership difference</em>. New York, NY: Random House.</span> identify five important traits that produce results:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Orientation and education</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p06">Coaches are teachers, motivators, and keepers of the goals of the group. There are times when members of the team forget that there is no “I” in the word “team.” At such times, coaches serve to redirect the attention and energy of the individuals to the overall goals of the group. They conduct the group with a sense of timing and tempo, and at times, they relax and let the members demonstrate their talents. Through their listening skills and counseling, they come to know each member as an individual, but keep the team focus for all to see. They set an example. Coaches, however, are human and by definition are not perfect. They can and do prefer some players over others and can display less than professional sideline behavior when they don’t agree with the referee, but the style of leadership is worthy of your consideration in its multidisciplinary approach. Coaches use more than one style of leadership and adapt to the context and environment. A skilled business communicator will recognize that this approach has its merits</p>
