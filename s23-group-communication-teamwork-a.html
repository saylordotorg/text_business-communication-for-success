        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s00_p01">As humans, we are social beings. We naturally form relationships with others. In fact, relationships are often noted as one of the most important aspects of a person’s life, and they exist in many forms. Interpersonal communication occurs between two people, but group communication may involve two or more individuals. Groups are a primary context for interaction within the business community. Groups may have heroes, enemies, and sages alongside new members. Groups overlap and may share common goals, but they may also engage in conflict. Groups can be supportive or coercive and can exert powerful influences over individuals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s00_p02">Within a group, individuals may behave in distinct ways, use unique or specialized terms, or display symbols that have meaning to that group. Those same terms or symbols may be confusing, meaningless, or even unacceptable to another group. An individual may belong to both groups, adapting his or her communication patterns to meet group normative expectations. Groups are increasingly important across social media venues, and there are many examples of successful business ventures on the Web that value and promote group interaction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s00_p03">Groups use words to exchange meaning, establish territory, and identify who is a stranger versus who is a trusted member. Are you familiar with the term “troll”? It is often used to identify someone who is not a member of an online group or community; does not share the values and beliefs of the group; and posts a message in an online discussion board to initiate flame wars, cause disruption, or otherwise challenge the group members. Members often use words to respond to the challenge that are not otherwise common in the discussions, and the less than flattering descriptions of the troll are a rallying point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s00_p04">Groups have existed throughout human history and continue to follow familiar patterns across emerging venues as we adapt to technology, computer-mediated interaction, suburban sprawl, and modern life. We need groups, and groups need us. Our relationship with groups warrants attention on this interdependence as we come to know our communities, our world, and ourselves.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>

            <li>Discuss how primary and secondary groups meet our interpersonal needs.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_p01">Let’s get into a time machine and travel way, way back to join early humans in prehistoric times. Their needs are like ours today: they cannot exist or thrive without air, food, and water—and a sense of belonging. How did they meet these needs? Through cooperation and competition. If food scarcity was an issue, who got more and who got less? This serves as our first introduction to roles, status and power, and hierarchy within a group. When food scarcity becomes an issue, who gets to keep their spoon? In some Latin American cultures, having a job or earning a living is referred to by the slang term <em class="emphasis">cuchara</em>, which literally means “spoon” and figuratively implies food, safety, and security.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_p02">Now let’s return to the present and enter a modern office. Cubicles define territories and corner offices denote status. In times of economic recession or slumping sales for the company, there is a greater need for cooperation, and there is competition for scarce resources. The loss of a “spoon”—or of one’s cubicle—may now come in the form of a pink slip, but it is no less devastating.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_p03">We form self-identities through our communication with others, and much of that interaction occurs in a group context. A group may be defined as three or more individuals who affiliate, interact, or cooperate in a familial, social, or work context. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Group communication</a><span class="glossdef">The exchange of information with those who are culturally, linguistically, and/or geographically alike.</span></span> may be defined as the exchange of information with those who are alike culturally, linguistically, and/or geographically. Group members may be known by their symbols, such as patches and insignia on a military uniform. They may be known by their use of specialized language or jargon; for example, someone in information technology may use the term “server” in reference to the Internet, whereas someone in the food service industry may use “server” to refer to the worker who takes customer orders in a restaurant. Group members may also be known by their proximity, as in gated communities. Regardless of how the group defines itself, and regardless of the extent to which its borders are porous or permeable, a group recognizes itself as a group. Humans naturally make groups a part of their context or environment.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Groups in the Workplace</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01_p01">As a skilled business communicator, learning more about groups, group dynamics, management, and leadership will serve you well. Mergers, forced sales, downsizing, and entering new markets all call upon individuals within a business or organization to become members of groups. In the second of the <a class="xref" href="mclean-ch19_s00#mclean-ch19_n01">Note 19.1 "Introductory Exercises"</a> for this chapter, you were asked to list the professional (i.e., work-related) groups you interact with in order of frequency. What did your list include? Perhaps you noted your immediate coworkers, your supervisor and other leaders in your work situation, members of other departments with whom you communicate, and the colleagues who are also your personal friends during off-work times. Groups may be defined by function. They can also be defined, from a developmental viewpoint, by the relationships within them. Groups can also be discussed in terms of their relationship to the individual and the degree to which they meet interpersonal needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01_p02">Some groups may be assembled at work to solve problems, and once the challenge has been resolved, they dissolve into previous or yet to be determined groups. Functional groups like this may be immediately familiar to you. You take a class in sociology from a professor of sociology, who is a member of the discipline of sociology. To be a member of a discipline is to be a disciple, and adhere to a common framework to for viewing the world. Disciplines involve a common set of theories that explain the world around us, terms to explain those theories, and have grown to reflect the advance of human knowledge. Compared to your sociology instructor, your physics instructor may see the world from a completely different perspective. Still, both may be members of divisions or schools, dedicated to teaching or research, and come together under the large group heading we know as the university.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01_p03">In business, we may have marketing experts who are members of the marketing department, who perceive their tasks differently from a member of the sales staff or someone in accounting. You may work in the mailroom, and the mailroom staff is a group in itself, both distinct from and interconnected with the larger organization.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01_p04">Relationships are part of any group, and can be described in terms of status, power, control, as well as role, function, or viewpoint. Within a family, for example, the ties that bind you together may be common experiences, collaborative efforts, and even pain and suffering. The birth process may forge a relationship between mother and daughter, but it also may not. An adoption may transform a family. Relationships are formed through communication interaction across time, and often share a common history, values, and beliefs about the world around us.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01_p05">In business, an idea may bring professionals together and they may even refer to the new product or service as their “baby,” speaking in reverent tones about a project they have taken from the drawing board and “birthed” into the real world. As in family communication, work groups or teams may have challenges, rivalries, and even “birthing pains” as a product is developed, adjusted, adapted, and transformed. Struggles are a part of relationships, both in families and business, and form a common history of shared challenged overcome through effort and hard work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01_p06">Through conversations and a shared sense that you and your coworkers belong together, you meet many of your basic human needs, such as the need to feel included, the need for affection, and the need for control.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_001">Schutz, W. (1966). <em class="emphasis">The interpersonal underworld</em>. Palo Alto, CA: Science and Behavior Books.</span> In a work context, “affection” may sound odd, but we all experience affection at work in the form of friendly comments like “good morning,” “have a nice weekend,” and “good job!” Our professional lives also fulfill more than just our basic needs (i.e., air, food, and water, as well as safety). While your work group may be gathered together with common goals, such as to deliver the mail in a timely fashion to the corresponding departments and individuals, your daily interactions may well go beyond this functional perspective.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s01_p07">In the same way, your family may provide a place for you at the table and meet your basic needs, but they also may not meet other needs. If you grow to understand yourself and your place in a way that challenges group norms, you will be able to choose which parts of your life to share and to withhold in different groups, and to choose where to seek acceptance, affection, and control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Primary and Secondary Groups</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s02_p01">There are fundamentally two types of groups that can be observed in many contexts, from church to school, family to work. These two types are primary and secondary groups. The hierarchy denotes the degree to which the group(s) meet your interpersonal needs. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Primary groups</a><span class="glossdef">Groups that meet most, if not all, of one’s needs.</span></span> meet most, if not all, of one’s needs. Groups that meet some, but not all, needs are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary groups</a><span class="glossdef">Groups that meet some, but not all, of individuals’ needs.</span></span>. Secondary groups often include work groups, where the goal is to complete a task or solve a problem. If you are a member of the sales department, your purpose is to sell.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s02_p02">In terms of problem solving, work groups can accomplish more than individuals can. People, each of whom have specialized skills, talents, experience, or education come together in new combinations with new challenges, find new perspectives to create unique approaches that they themselves would not have formulated alone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s02_p03">Secondary groups may meet your need for professional acceptance and celebrate your success, but they may not meet your need for understanding and sharing on a personal level. Family members may understand you in ways that your coworkers cannot, and vice versa.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">If Two’s Company and Three’s a Crowd, What Is a Group?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03_p01">This old cliché refers to the human tendency to form pairs. Pairing is the most basic form of relationship formation; it applies to childhood best friends, college roommates, romantic couples, business partners, and many other dyads (two-person relationships). A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">group</a><span class="glossdef">Three or more individuals who affiliate, interact or cooperate in a familial, social, or work context.</span></span>, by definition, includes at least three people. We can categorize groups in terms of their size and complexity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03_p02">When we discuss demographic groups as part of a market study, we may focus on large numbers of individuals that share common characteristics. If you are the producer of an ecologically innovative car such as the Smart ForTwo, and know your customers have an average of four members in their family, you may discuss developing a new model with additional seats. While the target audience is a group, car customers don’t relate to each other as a unified whole. Even if they form car clubs and have regional gatherings, a newsletter, and competitions at their local race tracks each year, they still subdivide the overall community of car owners into smaller groups.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03_p03">The larger the group grows, the more likely it is to subdivide. Analysis of these smaller, or microgroups, is increasingly a point of study as the Internet allows individuals to join people of similar mind or habit to share virtually anything across time and distance. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">microgroup</a><span class="glossdef">A small, independent group that has a link, affiliation, or association with a larger group.</span></span> is a small, independent group that has a link, affiliation, or association with a larger group. With each additional group member the number of possible interactions increases.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_002">Harris, T., &amp; Sherblom, J. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Small group and team communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span>,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_003">McLean, S. (2003). <em class="emphasis">The basics of speech communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03_p04">Small groups normally contain between three and eight people. One person may involve intrapersonal communication, while two may constitute interpersonal communication, and both may be present within a group communication context. You may think to yourself before making a speech or writing your next post, and you may turn to your neighbor or coworker and have a side conversation, but a group relationship normally involves three to eight people, and the potential for distraction is great.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03_p05">In <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch19_s01_s03_t01">Table 19.1 "Possible Interaction in Groups"</a>, you can quickly see how the number of possible interactions grows according to how many people are in the group. At some point, we all find the possible and actual interactions overwhelming and subdivide into smaller groups. For example, you may have hundreds of friends on MySpace or Facebook, but how many of them do you regularly communicate with? You may be tempted to provide a number greater than eight, but if you exclude the “all to one” messages, such as a general tweet to everyone (but no one person in particular), you’ll find the group norms will appear.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03_p06">Group norms are customs, standards, and behavioral expectations that emerge as a group forms. If you post an update every day on your Facebook page and your friends stop by to post on your wall and comment, not posting for a week will violate a group norm. They will wonder if you are sick or in the hospital where you have no access to a computer to keep them updated. If, however, you only post once a week, the group will come to naturally expect your customary post. Norms involve expectations that are self and group imposed and that often arise as groups form and develop.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s01_s03_p07">If there are more than eight members, it becomes a challenge to have equal participation, where everyone has a chance to speak, listen, and respond. Some will dominate, others will recede, and smaller groups will form. Finding a natural balance within a group can also be a challenge. Small groups need to have enough members to generate a rich and stimulating exchange of ideas, information, and interaction, but not so many people that what each brings cannot be shared.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_004">Galanes, G., Adams, K., &amp; Brilhart, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p01">Your life cycle is characterized with several steps, and while it doesn’t follow a prescribed path, there are universal stages we can all recognize. You were born. You didn’t choose your birth, your parents, your language, or your culture, but you came to know them through communication. You came to know yourself, learned skills, discovered talents, and met other people. You learned, worked, lived, and loved, and as you aged, minor injuries took longer to heal. You competed in ever-increasing age groups in your favorite sport, and while your time for each performance may have increased as you aged, your experience allowed you to excel in other ways. Where you were once a novice, you have now learned something to share. You lived to see some of your friends pass before you, and the moment will arrive when you too must confront death.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p02">In the same way, groups experience similar steps and stages and take on many of the characteristics we associate with life.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_005">Moreland, R., &amp; Levine, J.

At home, you may have learned some of the basics, like how to write with a pencil, but knowledge of that skill and its application are two different things. In school, people spoke and acted in different ways than at home. Gradually, you came to understand the meaning of recess, the importance of raising your hand to get the teacher’s attention, and how to follow other school rules. At work, you may have had academic training for your profession, but the knowledge you learned in school only serves as your foundation—much as your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">socialization</a><span class="glossdef">The process of learning to associate, communicate, or interact within a group.</span></span> at home served to guide you at school. On the job they use jargon terms, have schedules that may include coffee breaks (recess), have a supervisor (teacher), and have rules, explicit and understood. On the first day, it was all new, even if many of the elements were familiar.</p>

This stage is also called the orientation stage because individual group members come to know each other.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</span> The more we know about others and become accustomed to how they communicate, the better we can predict how they will interact with us in future contexts. If you learn that Monday mornings are never a good time for your supervisor, you quickly learn to schedule meetings later in the week. Individuals are initially tentative and display caution as they begin to learn about the group and its members.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p06">If you don’t know someone very well, it is easy to offend. Each group member brings to the group a set of experiences, combined with education and a self-concept. You won’t be able to read this information on a nametag, but instead you will only come to know it through time and interaction. Since the possibility of overlapping and competing viewpoints and perspectives exists, the group will experience a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">storming stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time of struggles as group members themselves sort out their differences.</span></span>, a time of struggles as the members themselves sort out their differences. There may be more than one way to solve the problem or task at hand, and some group members may prefer one strategy over another. Some members of the group may be more senior to the organization than you, and members may treat them differently. Some group members may be as new as you are and just as uncertain about everyone’s talents, skills, roles, and self-perceptions. The wise business communicator will anticipate the storming stage and help facilitate opportunities for the members to resolve uncertainty before the work commences. There may be challenges for leadership, and conflicting viewpoints. The sociology professor sees the world differently than the physics professor. The sales agent sees things differently than someone from accounting. A manager who understands and anticipates this normal challenge in the group’s life cycle can help the group become more productive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p07">A clear definition of the purpose and mission of the group can help the members focus their energies. Interaction prior to the first meeting can help reduce uncertainty. Coffee and calories can help bring a group together. Providing the group with what they need and opportunities to know each other prior to their task can increase efficiency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p08">Groups that make a successful transition from the storming stage will next experience the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">norming stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time when the group establishes norms, or informal rules, for behavior and interaction.</span></span>, where the group establishes norms, or informal rules, for behavior and interaction. Who speaks first? Who takes notes? Who is creative, who is visual, and who is detail-oriented? Sometimes our job titles and functions speak for themselves, but human beings are complex. We are not simply a list of job functions, and in the dynamic marketplace of today’s business environment you will often find that people have talents and skills well beyond their “official” role or task. Drawing on these strengths can make the group more effective.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p09">The norming stage is marked by less division and more collaboration. The level of anxiety associated with interaction is generally reduced, making for a more positive work climate that promotes listening. When people feel less threatened and their needs are met, they are more likely to focus their complete attention on the purpose of the group. If they are still concerned with who does what, and whether they will speak in error, the interaction framework will stay in the storming stage. Tensions are reduced when the normative expectations are known, and the degree to which a manager can describe these at the outset can reduce the amount of time the group remains in uncertainty. Group members generally express more satisfaction with clear expectations and are more inclined to participate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p10">Ultimately, the purpose of a work group is performance, and the preceding stages lead us to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">performing stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time when the group accomplishes its mandate, fulfills its purpose, and reaches its goals.</span></span>, in which the group accomplishes its mandate, fulfills its purpose, and reaches its goals. To facilitate performance, group members can’t skip the initiation of getting to know each other or the sorting out of roles and norms, but they can try to focus on performance with clear expectations from the moment the group is formed. Productivity is often how we measure success in business and industry, and the group has to produce. Outcome assessments may have been built into the system from the beginning to serve as a benchmark for success. Wise managers know how to celebrate success, as it brings more success, social cohesion, group participation, and a sense of job satisfaction. Incremental gains toward a benchmark may also be cause for celebration and support, and failure to reach a goal should be regarded as an opportunity for clarification.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p11">It is generally wiser to focus on the performance of the group rather than individual contributions. Managers and group members will want to offer assistance to underperformers as well as congratulate members for their contributions. If the goal is to create a community where competition pushes each member to perform, individual highlights may serve your needs, but if you want a group to solve a problem or address a challenge as a group, you have to promote group cohesion. Members need to feel a sense of belonging, and praise (or the lack thereof) can be a sword with two edges: one stimulates and motivates while the other demoralizes and divides.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p12">Groups should be designed to produce and perform in ways and at levels that individuals cannot, or else you should consider compartmentalizing the tasks. The performing stage is where the productivity occurs, and it is necessary to make sure the group has what it needs to perform. Missing pieces, parts, or information can stall the group, and reset the cycle to storming all over again. Loss of performance is inefficiency, which carries a cost. Managers will be measured by the group’s productivity and performance. Make sure the performing stage is one that is productive and healthy for its members.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p13">Imagine that you are the manager of a group that has produced an award-winning design for an ecologically innovative four-seat car. Their success is your success. Their celebrations are yours even if the success is not focused on you. A manager manages the process while group members perform. If you were a member of the group that helped design the belt line, you made a fundamental contribution to the style of the car. Individual consumers may never consider the line from the front fender, across the doors, to the rear taillight as they make a purchase decision, but they will recognize beauty. You will know that you could not have achieved that fundamental part of car design without help from the engineers in the group, and if the number-crunching accountants had not seen the efficiency of the production process that produced it, it may never have survived the transition from prototype to production. The group came together and accomplished its goals with amazing results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p14">Now, as typically happens, all groups will eventually have to move on to new assignments. In the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adjourning stage</a><span class="glossdef">Time when group members leave the group.</span></span>, members leave the group. The group may cease to exist or it may be transformed with new members and a new set of goals. Your contributions in the past may have caught the attention of the management, and you may be assigned to redesign the flagship vehicle, the halo car of your marque or brand. It’s quite a professional honor, and it’s yours because of your successful work in a group. Others will be reassigned to tasks that require their talents and skills, and you may or may not collaborate with them in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p15">You may miss the interactions with the members, even the more cantankerous ones, and will experience both relief and a sense of loss. Like life, the group process is normal, and mixed emotions are to be expected. A wise manager anticipates this stage and facilitates the separation with skill and ease. We often close this process with a ritual marking its passing, though the ritual may be as formal as an award or as informal as a “thank you” or a verbal acknowledgement of a job well done over coffee and calories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s01_p16">On a more sober note, it is important not to forget that groups can reach the adjourning stage without having achieved success. Some businesses go bankrupt, some departments are closed, and some individuals lose their positions after a group fails to perform. Adjournment can come suddenly and unexpectedly, or gradually and piece by piece. Either way, a skilled business communicator will be prepared and recognize it as part of the classic group life cycle.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p02">Suppose you are about to graduate from school and you are in the midst of an employment search. You’ve gathered extensive information on a couple of local businesses and are aware that they will be participating in the university job fair. You’ve explored their Web sites, talked to people currently employed at each company, and learned what you can from the public information available. At this stage, you are considered a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">potential member</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who is qualified to join a group but has not yet joined.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p03">You show up at the job fair in professional attire and completely prepared.

As a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">new group member</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who is still learning the group’s norms and rules.</span></span>, your level of acceptance will increase as you begin learning the groups’ rules, spoken and unspoken.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_013">Fisher, B.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p06">Over time and projects, you gradually increase your responsibilities. You are no longer looked at as the new person, and you can follow almost every conversation.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s02_p07">Full members of a group, however, can and do come into conflict.

Coworkers who have been working in the department for several years may be unwilling to adapt and change, resulting in tension. Expressing different views can cause conflict and may even interfere with communication.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s03_p02">Now that we’ve examined a classical view of positive and negative group member roles, let’s examine another perspective. While some personality traits and behaviors may negatively influence groups, some are positive or negative depending on the context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s03_p03">Just as the class clown can have a positive effect in lifting spirits or a negative effect in distracting members, a dominator may be exactly what is needed for quick action. An emergency physician doesn’t have time to ask all the group members in the emergency unit how they feel about a course of action; instead, a self-directed approach based on training and experience may be necessary. In contrast, the pastor of a church may have ample opportunity to ask members of the congregation their opinions about a change in the format of Sunday services; in this situation, the role of coordinator or elaborator is more appropriate than that of dominator.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s02_s03_p04">The group is together because they have a purpose or goal, and normally they are capable of more than any one individual member could be on their own, so it would be inefficient to hinder that progress. But a blocker, who cuts off collaboration, does just that. If a group member interrupts another and presents a viewpoint or information that suggests a different course of action, the point may be well taken and serve the collaborative process. But if that same group member repeatedly engages in blocking behavior, then the behavior becomes a problem. A skilled business communicator will learn to recognize the difference, even when positive and negative aren’t completely clear.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_p01">No matter who you are or where you live, problems are an inevitable part of life. This is true for groups as well as for individuals. Some groups—especially work teams—are formed specifically to solve problems. Other groups encounter problems for a wide variety of reasons. Within a family group, a problem might be that a daughter or son wants to get married and the parents do not approve of the marriage partner. In a work group, a problem might be that some workers are putting in more effort than others, yet achieving poorer results. Regardless of the problem, having the resources of a group can be an advantage, as different people can contribute different ideas for how to reach a satisfactory solution.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_p02">Once a group encounters a problem, the questions that come up range from “Where do we start?” to “How do we solve it?” While there are many ways to approach a problem, the American educational philosopher John Dewey’s reflective thinking sequence has stood the test of time. This seven-step process<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_020">Adler, R. (1996). <em class="emphasis">Communicating at work: Principles and practices for business and the professions</em>. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span> has produced positive results and serves as a handy organizational structure. If you are member of a group that needs to solve a problem and don’t know where to start, consider these seven simple steps in a format adapted from Scott McLean:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_021">McLean, S. (2005). <em class="emphasis">The basics of interpersonal communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span></p>

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_p03">Let’s discuss each step in detail.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Define the Problem</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s01_p01">If you don’t know what the problem is, how do you know you can solve it? Defining the problem allows the group to set boundaries of what the problem is and what it is not and to begin to formalize a description or definition of the scope, size, or extent of the challenge the group will address. A problem that is too broadly defined can overwhelm the group. If the problem is too narrowly defined, important information will be missed or ignored.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s01_p02">In the following example, we have a Web-based company called Favorites that needs to increase its customer base and ultimately sales. A problem-solving group has been formed, and they start by formulating a working definition of the problem.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s01_p03">Too broad: “Sales are off, our numbers are down, and we need more customers.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s01_p04">More precise: “Sales have been slipping incrementally for six of the past nine months and are significantly lower than a seasonally adjusted comparison to last year. Overall, this loss represents a 4.5 percent reduction in sales from the same time last year. However, when we break it down by product category, sales of our nonedible products have seen a modest but steady increase, while sales of edibles account for the drop off and we need to halt the decline.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Analyze the Problem</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s02_p01">Now the group analyzes the problem, trying to gather information and learn more. The problem is complex and requires more than one area of expertise. Why do nonedible products continue selling well? What is it about the edibles that is turning customers off? Let’s meet our problem solvers at Favorites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s02_p02">Kevin is responsible for customer resource management. He is involved with the customer from the point of initial contact through purchase and delivery. Most of the interface is automated in the form of an online “basket model,” where photographs and product descriptions are accompanied by “buy it” buttons. He is available during normal working business hours for live chat and voice chat if needed, and customers are invited to request additional information. Most Favorites customers do not access this service, but Kevin is kept quite busy, as he also handles returns and complaints. Because Kevin believes that superior service retains customers while attracting new ones, he is always interested in better ways to serve the customer. Looking at edibles and nonedibles, he will study the cycle of customer service and see if there are any common points—from the main Web page, through the catalog, to the purchase process, and to returns—at which customers abandon the sale. He has existing customer feedback loops with end-of-sale surveys, but most customers decline to take the survey and there is currently no incentive to participate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s02_p03">Mariah is responsible for products and purchasing. She wants to offer the best products at the lowest price, and to offer new products that are unusual, rare, or exotic. She regularly adds new products to the Favorites catalog and culls underperformers. Right now she has the data on every product and its sales history, but it is a challenge to represent it. She will analyze current sales data and produce a report that specifically identifies how each product—edible and nonedible—is performing. She wants to highlight “winners” and “losers” but also recognizes that today’s “losers” may be the hit of tomorrow. It is hard to predict constantly changing tastes and preferences, but that is part of her job. It’s not all science, and it’s not all art. She has to have an eye for what will catch on tomorrow while continuing to provide what is hot today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s02_p04">Suri is responsible for data management at Favorites. She gathers, analyzes, and presents information gathered from the supply chain, sales, and marketing. She works with vendors to make sure products are available when needed, makes sales predictions based on past sales history, and assesses the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s02_p05">The problem-solving group members already have certain information on hand. They know that customer retention is one contributing factor. Attracting new customers is a constant goal, but they are aware of the well-known principle that it takes more effort to attract new customers than to keep existing ones. Thus, it is important to insure a quality customer service experience for existing customers and encourage them to refer friends. The group needs to determine how to promote this favorable customer behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s02_p06">Another contributing factor seems to be that customers often abandon the shopping cart before completing a purchase, especially when purchasing edibles. The group members need to learn more about why this is happening.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Establish Criteria</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s03_p01">Establishing the criteria for a solution is the next step. At this point, information is coming in from diverse perspectives, and each group member has contributed information from their perspective, even though there may be several points of overlap.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s03_p02">Kevin: Customers who complete the postsale survey indicate that they want to know (1) what is the estimated time of delivery, (2) why a specific item was not in stock and when it will be available, and (3) why their order sometimes arrives with less than a complete order, with some items back-ordered, without prior notification.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s03_p03">He notes that a very small percentage of customers complete the postsale survey, and the results are far from scientific. He also notes that it appears the interface is not capable of cross-checking inventory to provide immediate information concerning back orders, so that the customer “buys it” only to learn several days later that it was not in stock. This seems to be especially problematic for edible products, because people may tend to order them for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries. But we don’t really know this for sure because of the low participation in the postsale survey.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s03_p04">Mariah: There are four edible products that frequently sell out. So far, we haven’t been able to boost the appeal of other edibles so that people would order them as a second choice when these sales leaders aren’t available. We also have several rare, exotic products that are slow movers. They have potential, but currently are underperformers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s03_p05">Suri: We know from a zip code analysis that most of our customers are from a few specific geographic areas associated with above-average incomes. We have very few credit cards declined, and the average sale is over $100. Shipping costs represent on average 8 percent of the total sales cost. We do not have sufficient information to produce a customer profile. There is no specific point in the purchase process where basket abandonment tends to happen; it happens fairly uniformly at all steps.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Consider Possible Solutions to the Problem</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s04_p01">The group has listened to each other and now starts to brainstorm ways to address the challenges they have addressed while focusing resources on those solutions that are more likely to produce results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s04_p02">Kevin: Is it possible for our programmers to create a cross-index feature, linking the product desired with a report of how many are in stock? I’d like the customer to know right away whether it is in stock, or how long they may have to wait. As another idea, is it possible to add incentives to the purchase cycle that won’t negatively impact our overall profit? I’m thinking a small volume discount on multiple items, or perhaps free shipping over a specific dollar amount.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s04_p03">Mariah: I recommend we hold a focus group where customers can sample our edible products and tell us what they like best and why. When the best sellers are sold out, could we offer a discount on related products to provide an instant alternative? We might also cull the underperforming products with a liquidation sale to generate interest.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s04_p04">Suri: If we want to know more about our customers, we need to give them an incentive to complete the postsale survey. How about a 5 percent off coupon code for the next purchase to get them to return and to help us better identify our customer base? We may also want to build in a customer referral rewards program, but it all takes better data in to get results out. We should also explore the supply side of the business by getting a more reliable supply of the leading products and trying to get discounts that are more advantageous from our suppliers, especially in the edible category.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s05_p01">Kevin, Mariah, and Suri may want to implement all the solution strategies, but they do not have the resources to do them all.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s05_p02">Now that the options have been presented with their costs and benefits, it is easier for the group to decide which courses of action are likely to yield the best outcomes. The analysis helps the group members to see beyond the immediate cost of implementing a given solution. For example, Kevin’s suggestion of offering free shipping won’t cost Favorites much money, but it also may not pay off in customer goodwill. And even though Mariah’s suggestion of having a focus group might sound like a good idea, it will be expensive and its benefits are questionable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s05_p03">A careful reading of the analysis indicates that Kevin’s best suggestion is to integrate the cross-index feature in the ordering process so that customers can know immediately whether an item is in stock or on back order. Mariah, meanwhile, suggests that searching for alternative products is probably the most likely to benefit Favorites, while Suri’s two supply-side suggestions are likely to result in positive outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Implement the Solution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s06_p01">Kevin is faced with the challenge of designing the computer interface without incurring unacceptable costs. He strongly believes that the interface will pay for itself within the first year—or, to put it more bluntly, that Favorites’ declining sales will get worse if the Web site does not have this feature soon. He asks to meet with top management to get budget approval and secures their agreement, on one condition: he must negotiate a compensation schedule with the Information Technology consultants that includes delayed compensation in the form of bonuses after the feature has been up and running successfully for six months.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s06_p02">Mariah knows that searching for alternative products is a never-ending process, but it takes time and the company needs results. She decides to invest time evaluating products that competing companies currently offer, especially in the edible category, on the theory that customers who find their desired items sold out on the Favorites Web site may have been buying alternative products elsewhere instead of choosing an alternative from Favorites’s product lines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s06_p03">Suri decides to approach the vendors of the four frequently sold-out products and ask point blank, “What would it take to get you to produce these items more reliably in greater quantities?” By opening the channel of communication with these vendors, she is able to motivate them to make modifications that will improve the reliability and quantity. She also approaches the vendors of the less popular products with a request for better discounts in return for their cooperation in developing and test-marketing new products.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Follow Up on the Solution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s07_p01">Kevin: After several beta tests, the cross-index feature was implemented and has been in place for thirty days. Now customers see either “in stock” or “available [mo/da/yr]” in the shopping basket. As expected, Kevin notes a decrease in the number of chat and phone inquiries to the effect of, “Will this item arrive before my wife’s birthday?” However, he notes an increase in inquiries asking, “Why isn’t this item in stock?” It is difficult to tell whether customer satisfaction is higher overall.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s07_p02">Mariah: In exploring the merchandise available from competing merchants, she got several ideas for modifying Favorites’ product line to offer more flavors and other variations on popular edibles. Working with vendors, she found that these modifications cost very little. Within the first thirty days of adding these items to the product line, sales are up. Mariah believes these additions also serve to enhance the Favorites brand identity, but she has no data to back this up.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s07_p03">Suri: So far, the vendors supplying the four top-selling edibles have fulfilled their promise of increasing quantity and reliability. However, three of the four items have still sold out, raising the question of whether Favorites needs to bring in one or more additional vendors to produce these items. Of the vendors with which Favorites asked to negotiate better discounts, some refused, and two of these were “stolen” by a competing merchant so that they no longer sell to Favorites. In addition, one of the vendors that agreed to give a better discount was unexpectedly forced to cease operations for several weeks because of a fire.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s03_s07_p04">This scenario allows us to see that the problem may have several dimensions as well as solutions, but resources can be limited and not every solution is successful. Even though the problem is not immediately resolved, the group problem-solving pattern serves as a useful guide through the problem-solving process.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_p01">Business and professional meetings are a part of the communication climate of any business. Some view meetings as boring, pointless, and futile exercises, while others see them as opportunities to exchange information and produce results. A combination of preparation and execution makes all the difference. Remember, too, that meetings do not have to take place in a physical space where the participants meet face to face. Instead, a number of technological tools make it possible to hold virtual meetings in which the participants are half a world away from one another. Virtual meetings are formally arranged gatherings where participants, located in distinct geographic locations, come together via the Internet.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preparation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p01">A meeting, like a problem-solving group, needs a clear purpose statement. The specific goal for the specific meeting will clearly relate to the overall goal of the group or committee. Determining your purpose is central to an effective meeting and getting together just to get together is called a party, not a meeting. Do not schedule a meeting just because you met at the same time last month or because it is a standing committee. Members will resent the intrusion into their schedules and quickly perceive the lack of purpose.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p02">Similarly, if the need for a meeting arises, do not rush into it without planning. A poorly planned meeting announced at the last minute is sure to be less than effective. People may be unable to change their schedules, may fail to attend, or may impede the progress and discussion of the group because of their absence. Those who attend may feel hindered because they needed more time to prepare and present comprehensive results to the group or committee.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p03">If a meeting is necessary, and a clear purpose can be articulated, then you’ll need to decide how and where to meet. Distance is no longer an obstacle to participation, as we will see later in this section when we explore some of the technologies for virtual meetings. However, there are many advantages to meeting in person. People communicate not just with words but also with their body language—facial expressions, hand gestures, head nodding or head shaking, and posture. These subtleties of communication can be key to determining how group members really feel about an issue or question. Meeting in real time can be important, too, as all group members have the benefit of receiving new information at the same time. For purposes of our present discussion, we will focus on meetings taking place face to face in real time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p04">If you have a purpose statement for the meeting, then it also follows that you should be able to create an agenda, or a list of topics to be discussed. You may need to solicit information from members to formulate an agenda, and this premeeting contact can serve to encourage active participation. The agenda will have a time, date, place, and method of interaction noted, as well as a list of participants. It will also have a statement of purpose, a list of points to be considered, and a brief summary of relevant information that relates to each point. Somewhere on the agenda the start and end times need to be clearly indicated, and it is always a good idea to leave time at the end for questions and additional points that individual members may want to share. If the meeting has an emotional point or theme, or the news is negative, plan for additional time for discussion, clarification, and recycling of conversations as the participants process the information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p05">If you are planning an intense work session, you need to consider the number of possible interactions among the participants and limit them. Smaller groups are generally more productive. If you are gathering to present information or to motivate the sales staff, a large audience, where little interaction is expected, is appropriate. Each member has a role, and attention to how and why they are interacting will produce the best results. Review the stages of group formation in view of the idea that a meeting is a short-term group. You can anticipate a “forming” stage, and if roles are not clear, there may be a bit of “storming” before the group establishes norms and becomes productive. Adding additional participants for no clear reason will only make the process more complex and may produce negative results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p06">Inviting the participants via e-mail has become increasingly common across business and industry. Software programs like Microsoft Outlook allow you to initiate a meeting request and receive an “accept” or “decline” response that makes the invitation process organized and straightforward. Reliance on a software program, however, may not be enough to encourage and ensure participation. A reminder on the individual’s computer may go off fifteen minutes prior to the meeting, but if they are away from their computer or if Outlook is not running, the reminder will go unseen and unheard. A reminder e-mail on the day of the meeting, often early in the morning, can serve as a personal effort to highlight the activities of the day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s01_p07">If you are the person responsible for the room reservation, confirm the reservation a week before the meeting and again the day before the meeting. Redundancy in the confirmation process can help eliminate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double-booking</a><span class="glossdef">Misunderstanding in which two meetings are scheduled at the same time in the same place.</span></span> a room, where two meetings are scheduled at the same time. If technology is required at the meeting, such as a microphone, conference telephone, or laptop and projector, make sure you confirm their reservation at the same time as you confirm the meeting room reservation. Always personally inspect the room and test these systems prior to the meeting. There is nothing more embarrassing than introducing a high-profile speaker, such as the company president, and then finding that the PowerPoint projector is not working properly.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conducting the Meeting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p01">The world is a stage and a meeting is a performance, the same as an interview or speech presentation. Each member has a part to perform and they should each be aware of their roles and responsibilities prior to the meeting. Everyone is a member of the group, ranging from new members to full members. If you can reduce or eliminate the storming stage, all the better. A clearly defined agenda can be a productive tool for this effort.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p02">People may know each other by role or title, but may not be familiar with each other. Brief introductions can serve to establish identity, credibility, and help the group transition to performance. The purpose of the meeting should be clearly stated, and if there are rules or guidelines that require a specific protocol, they should be introduced.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p03">Mary Ellen Guffey<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_022">Guffey, M. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Essentials of business communication</em> (7th ed.). Mason, OH: Thomson/Wadsworth.</span> provides a useful participant checklist that is adapted here for our use:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Arrive on time and stay until the meeting adjourns (unless there are prior arrangements)</li>
            <li>Leave the meeting only for established breaks or emergencies</li>
            <li>Be prepared and have everything you need on hand</li>
            <li>Turn off cell phones and personal digital assistants</li>
            <li>Follow the established protocol for turn taking</li>
            <li>Respect time limits</li>
            <li>Demonstrate professionalism in your verbal and nonverbal interactions</li>
            <li>Communicate interest and stay engaged in the discussion</li>
            <li>Avoid tangents and side discussions</li>
            <li>Respect space and don’t place your notebook or papers all around you</li>
            <li>Clean up after yourself</li>
            <li>Engage in polite conversation after the conclusion</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p04">If you are cast in the role of meeting leader, you may need to facilitate the discussion and address conflict. The agenda serves as your guide and you may need to redirect the discussion to the topic, but always demonstrate respect for each and every member. You may also need to intervene if a point has reached a stalemate in terms of conflict (this text offers specific guidelines for managing interpersonal conflict that apply here).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p05">There has been quite a discussion on the role of seating arrangements in meeting within the field of business communication. Generally, a table that is square, rectangular, or U-shaped has a fixed point at which the attention is directed, often referred to as the head of the table. This space is often associated with power, status, and hierarchy and may play an important role in the flow of interactions across the meeting. If information is to be distributed and presented from administration to managers, for example, a table with a clear focal point for the head or CEO may be indicated. Tables that are round, or tables arranged in a circular pattern, allow for a more egalitarian model of interaction, reducing the hierarchical aspects while reinforcing the clear line of sight among all participants. If a meeting requires intense interaction and collaboration, generally a round table or a circular pattern is indicated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p06">Some meetings do not call for a table, but rather rows of seats all facing toward the speaker; you probably recognize this arrangement from many class lectures you have attended. For relatively formal meetings in which information is being delivered to a large number of listeners and little interaction is desired, seating in rows is an efficient use of space.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p07">Transitions are often the hardest part of any meeting. Facilitating the transition from one topic to the next may require you to create links between each point. You can specifically note the next point on the agenda and verbally introduce the next speaker or person responsible for the content area. Once the meeting has accomplished its goals in the established time frame, it is time to facilitate the transition to a conclusion. You may conclude by summarizing what has been discussed or decided, and what actions the group members are to take as a result of the meeting. If there is a clear purpose for holding a subsequent meeting, discuss the time and date, and specifically note assignments for next time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s02_p08">Feedback is an important part of any communication interaction. Minutes are a written document that serves to record the interaction and can provide an opportunity for clarification. Minutes often appear as the agenda with notes in relation to actions taken during the meeting or specific indications of who is responsible for what before the next meeting. In many organizations, minutes of the meeting are tentative, like a rough draft, until they are approved by the members of the group or committee. Normally minutes are sent within a week of the meeting if it is a monthly event, and more quickly if the need to meet more frequently has been determined. If your organization does not call for minutes, you can still benefit by reviewing your notes after a meeting and comparing them with those of others to make sure you understood what was discussed and did not miss—or misinterpret—any key information.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Technology to Facilitate Meetings</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_p01">Given the widespread availability and increasingly low cost of electronic communication, technologies that once served to bring people together across continents and time zones are now also serving people in the same geographic area. Rather than traveling (by plane, car, or even elevator within the same building) to a central point for a face-to-face interaction, busy and cost-conscious professionals often choose to see and hear each other via one of many different electronic interface technologies. It is important to be aware of the dimensions of nonverbal communication that are lost in a virtual meeting compared to an in-person meeting. Nevertheless, these technologies are a boon to today’s business organizations, and knowing how to use them is a key skill for all job seekers. We will discuss the technologies by category, beginning with audio-only, then audio-visual, and finally social media.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Audio-Only Interactions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p01">The simplest form of audio-only interaction is, of course, a telephone call. Chances are that you have been using the phone all your life, yet did you know that some executives hire professional voice coaches to help them increase their effectiveness in phone communication? When you stop to think about it, we use a great many audio-only modes of communication, ranging from phone calls and voice-activated telephone menus to radio interviews, public address systems, dictation recording systems, and computer voice recognition technology. The importance of audio communication in the business world has increased with the availability of conference calls, Web conferences, and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) communications.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p02">Your voice has qualities that cannot be communicated in written form, and you can use these qualities to your advantage as you interact with colleagues. If you are sending a general informative message to all employees, an e-mail may serve you well, but if you are congratulating one employee on receiving an industry award, your voice as the channel carries your enthusiasm.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p03">Take care to pay attention to your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pronunciation</a><span class="glossdef">The way a word or phrase sounds when stated orally.</span></span> of words, stating them correctly in normal ways, and avoiding words that you are not comfortable with as you may mispronounce them. Mispronunciation can have a negative impact on your reputation or perceived credibility. Instead of using complicated words that may cause you to stumble, choose a simple phrase if you can, or learn to pronounce the word correctly before you use it in a formal interactive setting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p04">Your voice quality, volume, and pitch also influence how your spoken words are interpreted. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Quality</a><span class="glossdef">Emotional tone of one’s voice.</span></span> often refers to emotional tone of your voice, from happy and enthusiastic to serious or even sad. In most business situations, it is appropriate to speak with some level of formality, yet avoid sounding stilted or arrogant. Your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">volume</a><span class="glossdef">Loudness or softness of one’s voice.</span></span> (the loudness of your voice) should be normal, but do make sure your listeners can hear you. In some situations, you may be using a directional microphone that only amplifies your voice signal if you speak directly into it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p05">If your audience includes English learners, remember that speaking louder (i.e., shouting) does not help them to understand you any better than speaking in a normal tone. Your word choices will make a much more significant impact when communicating across cultures; strive to use direct sentences and avoid figures of speech that do not translate literally.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pitch</a><span class="glossdef">Frequency, high or low, of one’s voice.</span></span> refers to the frequency, high or low, of your voice. A pleasant, natural voice will have some variation in pitch. A speaker with a flat pitch, or a monotone (one-tone) voice, is often interpreted as being bored and often bores his or her listeners.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s01_p07">If you are leaving a voice mail, state all the relevant information in concise, clear terms, making sure to speak slowly; don’t forget to include your contact information, even if you think the person already knows your phone number. Imagine you were writing down your phone number as you recite it and you will be better able to record it at a “listener-friendly” speed. Don’t leave a long, rambling voice mail message. You may later wish you had said less, and the more content you provide the more you increase the possibility for misunderstandings without your being present for clarification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Audio-Visual Interactions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02_p01">Rather than call each other, we often call and interact in both audio and visual ways via the Internet. There are several ways to interface via audio and video, and new technologies in this area are being invented all the time. For example, VoIP software allows the participants to see and hear each other across time and distance with one-on-one calls and video conferencing. The audio portion of the call comes through a headset, and the callers see each other on their computer monitors, as if they were being broadcast on television. This form of audio-visual communication is quickly becoming a low- or no-cost business tool for interaction.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02_p02">If you are going to interact via audio and visual signals, make sure you are prepared. Appropriate dress, setting, and attitude are all required. The integration of a visual signal to the traditional phone call means that nonverbal gestures can now be observed in real time and can both aid and detract from the message.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s02_p03">If you are unfamiliar with the technology, practice with it before your actual business interaction. Try out the features with a friend and know where to find and access the information. If the call doesn’t go as planned, or the signal isn’t what you expected or experienced in the past, keep a good attitude and try again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Social Media</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p01">Online communities, forums, blogs, tweets, cloud computing, and avatar-activated environments are some of the continually developing means of social media being harnessed by the business world. The Internet is increasingly promoting tools and platforms for people to interact. From bulletin boards that resemble the FreeNet posts of years past, to interactive environments like Second Life, people are increasingly representing and interpreting themselves online.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_p02">Humans seek interaction, and this has led to new ways to market, advertise, and interact; however, caution is warranted when engaging in social media online. When you use these media, remember a few simple cautions:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>Not everything is at it appears. The individuals on the forum may not all be who they represent themselves to be.</li>
                <li>The words you write and the images you send, regardless of how much you trust the recipient, may become public and can remain online forever.</li>
                <li>Always consider what you access and what you post, and how it represents you and your employer, even if you think others cannot know where you work or who you are.</li>
                <li>Be aware that Internet service providers (ISPs) are required by law to archive information concerning the use and traffic of information that can become available under subpoena.</li>
            </ol>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s04_p01">Businesses and companies are often described in terms we normally associate with family, from relationships between siblings, to dominant-subordinate roles between parents and children, and the role of praise and correction. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organizational communication</a><span class="glossdef">The study of the communication context, environment, and interaction within an organization.</span></span>, or the study of the communication context, environment, and interaction within an organization, was once the domain of speech communication departments.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s04_p02">Organizations have communication needs and challenges just like a family, a group, or a community. We can examine the study of communication within an organization, noting common interactive practices like performance reviews, newsletters, supervisor and direction, and the flow of information throughout the organization. We can also study the practices of the organization as they relate to other organizations and the media, as is public relations, crisis communication plans, and interorganizational interaction. Research into these areas often emphasizes the outcome, in terms of increased productivity and more effective strategic communication systems.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_023">Tucker, M., Meyer, G., &amp; Westman, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s04_s04_p03">As a skilled business writer or communicator, you can see that the study of organizational communication can serve to inform you on the lessons learned by other companies, which are often represented in research publications, to improve the processes in place within your organization. For example, crisis management once was a knee-jerk reaction to a situation, one that caused businesses and companies to experience chaos and information management in unanticipated ways, leading to mistakes and damaging reputations. Crisis communication plans are now a common feature in business, outlining roles and responsibilities, as well as central communication coordination and how to interact with media. Supervisors and employees then have a guide to serve everyone, much like a common playbook in organized sports like football, where everyone knows everyone else’s position on the field once an emergency occurs.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_p01">Two important aspects of group communication—especially in the business environment—are teamwork and leadership. You will work in a team and at some point may be called on to lead. You may emerge to that role as the group recognizes your specific skill set in relation to the task, or you may be appointed to a position of responsibility for yourself and others. Your communication skills will be your foundation for success as a member and as a leader. Listen and seek to understand both the task and your group members as you become involved with the new effort. Have confidence in yourself and inspire the trust of others. Know that leading and following are both integral aspects of effective teamwork.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Teamwork</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p01">Teamwork is a compound word, combining team and work. Teams are a form of group normally dedicated to production or problem solving. That leaves us with the work. This is where our previous example on problem solving can serve us well. Each member of the team has skills, talents, experience, and education. Each is expected to contribute. Work is the activity, and while it may be fun or engaging, it also requires effort and commitment, as there is a schedule for production with individual and group responsibilities. Each member must fulfill his or her own obligations for the team to succeed, and the team, like a chain, is only as strong as its weakest member. In this context we don’t measure strength or weakness at the gym, but in terms of productivity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p02">Teams can often achieve higher levels of performance than individuals because of the combined energies and talents of the members. Collaboration can produce motivation and creativity that may not be present in single-contractor projects. Individuals also have a sense of belonging to the group, and the range of views and diversity can energize the process, helping address creative blocks and stalemates. By involving members of the team in decision-making, and calling up on each member’s area of contribution, teams can produce positive results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p03">Teamwork is not without its challenges. The work itself may prove a challenge as members juggle competing assignments and personal commitments. The work may also be compromised if team members are expected to conform and pressured to go along with a procedure, plan, or product that they themselves have not developed. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Groupthink</a><span class="glossdef">Tendency to accept the group’s ideas and actions in spite of individual concerns.</span></span>, or the tendency to accept the group’s ideas and actions in spite of individual concerns, can also compromise the process and reduce efficiency. Personalities and competition can play a role in a team’s failure to produce.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p04">We can recognize that people want to belong to a successful team, and celebrating incremental gain can focus the attention on the project and its goals. Members will be more willing to express thoughts and opinions, and follow through with actions, when they perceive that they are an important part of the team. By failing to include all the team members, valuable insights may be lost in the rush to judgment or production. Making time for planning, and giving each member time to study, reflect, and contribute can allow them to gain valuable insights from each other, and may make them more likely to contribute information that challenges the status quo. Unconventional or “devil’s advocate” thinking may prove insightful and serve to challenge the process in a positive way, improving the production of the team. Respect for divergent views can encourage open discussion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p05">John Thill and Courtland Bovee<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_024">Thill, J. V., &amp; Bovee, C. L. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Essentials of business communication</em>. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> provide a valuable list to consider when setting up a team, which we have adapted here for our discussion:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Select team members wisely</li>
            <li>Select a responsible leader</li>
            <li>Promote cooperation</li>
            <li>Clarify goals</li>

            <li>Ensure technological compatibility</li>
            <li>Provide prompt feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s01_p06">Group dynamics involve the interactions and processes of a team and influence the degree to which members feel a part of the goal and mission. A team with a strong identity can prove to be a powerful force, but it requires time and commitment. A team that exerts too much control over individual members can run the risk or reducing creative interactions and encourage tunnel vision. A team that exerts too little control, with attention to process and areas of specific responsibility, may not be productive. The balance between motivation and encouragement, and control and influence, is challenging as team members represent diverse viewpoints and approaches to the problem. A skilled business communicator creates a positive team by first selecting members based on their areas of skill and expertise, but attention to their style of communication is also warranted. Individuals that typically work alone or tend to be introverted may need additional encouragement to participate. Extroverts may need to be encouraged to listen to others and not dominate the conversation. Teamwork involves teams and work, and group dynamics play an integral role in their function and production.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Leadership</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p01">Whether or not there is a “natural leader,” born with a combination of talents and traits that enable a person to lead others, has been a subject of debate across time. In a modern context, we have come to recognize that leadership comes in many form and representations. Once it was thought that someone with presence of mind, innate intelligence, and an engaging personality was destined for leadership, but modern research and experience shows us otherwise. Just as a successful heart surgeon has a series of skill sets, so does a dynamic leader. A television producer must both direct and provide space for talent to create, balancing control with confidence and trust. This awareness of various leadership styles serves our discussion as groups and teams often have leaders, and they may not always be the person who holds the title, status, or role.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p02">Leaders take on the role because they are appointed, elected, or emerge into the role. The group members play an important role in this process. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">appointed leader</a><span class="glossdef">Individual designated by an authority to serve in the leadership capacity.</span></span> is designated by an authority to serve in that capacity, irrespective of the thoughts or wishes of the group. They may serve as the leader and accomplish all the designated tasks, but if the group does not accept their role as leader, it can prove to be a challenge. As Bruce Tuckman<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_025">Tuckman, B. (1965). Developmental sequence in small groups. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 63</em>, 384–399.</span> notes, “storming” occurs as group members come to know each other and communicate more freely, and an appointed leader who lacks the endorsement of the group may experience challenges to his or her authority.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p03">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">democratic leader</a><span class="glossdef">Individual elected by a group to serve as its leader.</span></span> is elected or chosen by the group, but may also face serious challenges. If individual group members or constituent groups feel neglected or ignored, they may assert that the democratic leader does not represent their interests. The democratic leader involves the group in the decision-making process, and insures group ownership of the resulting decisions and actions as a result. Open and free discussions are representative of this process, and the democratic leader acknowledges this diversity of opinion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_p04">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emergent leader</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who grows into the leadership role, often out of necessity.</span></span> contrasts the first two paths to the role by growing into the role, often out of necessity. The appointed leader may know little about the topic or content, and group members will naturally look to the senior member with the most experience for leadership. If the democratic leader fails to bring the group together, or does not represent the whole group, subgroups may form, each with an informal leader serving as spokesperson.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Leaders</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p01">We can see types of leaders in action and draw on common experience for examples. The heart surgeon does not involve everyone democratically, is typically appointed to the role through earned degrees and experience, and resembles a military sergeant more than a politician. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">autocratic leader</a><span class="glossdef">Self-directed leader who establishes norms and conduct for the group.</span></span> is self-directed and often establishes norms and conduct for the group. In some settings we can see that this is quite advantageous, such as open-heart surgery or during a military exercise, but it does not apply equally to all leadership opportunities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p02">Contrasting the autocrat is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">laissez-faire</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who practices a “live and let live” style of leadership.</span></span>, or “live and let live” leader. In a professional setting, such as a university, professors may bristle at the thought of an autocratic leader telling them what to do. They have earned their role through time, effort, and experience and know their job. A wise laissez-faire leader recognizes this aspect of working with professionals and may choose to focus efforts on providing the professors with the tools they need to make a positive impact. Imagine that you are in the role of a television director and you have a vision or idea of what the successful pilot program should look like. The script is set, the lighting correct, and the cameras are in the correct position. You may tell people what to do and where to stand, but you remember that your job is to facilitate the overall process. You work with talent, and creative people are interesting on camera. If you micromanage your actors, they may perform in ways that are not creative and that will not draw audiences. If you let them run wild through improvisation, the program may not go well at all. Balancing the need for control with the need for space is the challenge of the laissez-faire leader.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p03">Not all leaders are autocrats or laissez-faire leaders. Thomas Harris and John Sherblom<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_026">Harris, T., &amp; Sherblom, J. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Small group and team communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> specifically note three leadership styles that characterize the modern business or organization, and reflect our modern economy. We are not born leaders but may become them if the context or environment requires our skill set. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leader-as-technician</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when the leader has skills that others do not.</span></span> role often occurs when we have skills that others do not. If you can fix the copy machine at the office, your leadership and ability to get it running again are prized and sought-after skills. You may instruct others on how to load the paper or how to change the toner, and even though your pay grade may not reflect this leadership role, you are looked to by the group as a leader within that context. Technical skills, from Internet technology to facilities maintenance, may experience moments where their particular area of knowledge is required to solve a problem. Their leadership will be in demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p04">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leader-as-conductor</a><span class="glossdef">Central role of bringing people together for a common goal.</span></span> involves a central role of bringing people together for a common goal. In the common analogy, a conductor leads an orchestra and integrates the specialized skills and sounds of the various components the musical group comprises. In the same way, a leader who conducts may set a vision, create benchmarks, and collaborate with a group as they interpret a set script. Whether it is a beautiful movement in music or a group of teams that comes together to address a common challenge, the leader-as-conductor keeps the time and tempo of the group.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p05">Coaches are often discussed in business-related books as models of leadership for good reason. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leader-as-coach</a><span class="glossdef">Individual serving as a teacher, motivator, and keeper of the goals of the group.</span></span> combines many of the talents and skills we’ve discussed here, serving as a teacher, motivator, and keeper of the goals of the group. A coach may be autocratic at times, give pointed direction without input from the group, and stand on the sidelines while the players do what they’ve been trained to do and make the points. The coach may look out for the group and defend it against bad calls, and may motivate players with words of encouragement. We can recognize some of the behaviors of coaches, but what specific traits have a positive influence on the group? Thomas Peters and Nancy Austin<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn19_027">Peters, T., &amp; Austin, N. (1985). <em class="emphasis">A passion for excellence: The leadership difference</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch19_s05_s02_s01_p06">Coaches are teachers, motivators, and keepers of the goals of the group. There are times when members of the team forget that there is no “I” in the word “team.” At such times, coaches serve to redirect the attention and energy of the individuals to the overall goals of the group. They conduct the group with a sense of timing and tempo, and at times, they relax and let the members demonstrate their talents. Through their listening skills and counseling, they come to know each member as an individual, but keep the team focus for all to see. They set an example. Coaches, however, are human and by definition are not perfect. They can and do prefer some players over others and can display less than professional sideline behavior when they don’t agree with the referee, but the style of leadership is worthy of your consideration in its multidisciplinary approach. Coaches use more than one style of leadership and adapt to the context and environment. A skilled business communicator will recognize that this approach has its merits</p>
